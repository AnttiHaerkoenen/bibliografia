	volume={20},
	number={2},
	pages={135-152},
	abstract={Historical GIS has the potential to re-invigorate our use of statistics from historical censuses and related sources. In particular, areal interpolation can be used to create long-run time-series of spatially detailed data that will enable us to enhance significantly our understanding of geographical change over periods of a century or more. The difficulty with areal interpolation, however, is that the data that it generates are estimates which will inevitably contain some error. This paper describes a technique that allows the automated identification of possible errors at the level of the individual data values.},

	abstract={Iconographic sources depicting Thirty Years’ War battlefields in the Czech lands can be found in historical graphic works printed in the most comprehensive documentary publication of the 17 th century, the Theatrum Europaeum. In this publication, the year 1647 is one of the richest in terms of the number of engravings depicting the course of the war. In addition, the Swedish campaign of the same year left behind the most numerous and best preserved traces in the landscape of the Czech lands. The paper focuses primarily on engravings related to war events at the locations of Cheb, Třebel and Teplá. It presents interim results of interdisciplinary research of these iconographic sources, which involves the tools of spatial analyses, digital terrain modelling and also new possibilities of airborne laser scanning data processing. The main aims of the research, which are also being implemented, are the confirmation of depicted localities and their localization; analyses of the scale and geometrical precision of displayed landscape; estimates of visibility and methods of creating the source materials for engravings; and a detailed comparison with other contemporary or current cartographic sources.},

	journal={Transactions in GIS},
	volume={13},
	number={4},
	pages={401-414},
	abstract={Population data used in GIS analyses is generally assumed to be homogeneous and planar (i.e. census tracts, townships or prefectures) due to the public unavailability of building population data. However, information on building population is required for micro-spatial analysis for improved disaster management and emergency preparedness, public facility management for urban planning, consumer and retail market analysis, environment and public health programs and other demographic studies. This article discusses a GIS approach using the Areametric and Volumetric methods for estimating building population based on census tracts and building footprint datasets. The estimated results were evaluated using actual building population data by visual, statistical and spatial means, and validated for use in micro-spatial analysis. We have also implemented a standalone GIS tool (known as 'PopShape GIS') for generating new building footprint with population attribute information based on user-defined criteria.

	journal={Transactions in GIS},
	volume={12},
	number={1},
	pages={83-101},
	abstract={Brazil is one of the countries of the world where the ownership cadastre is still based on textual descriptions. Until 2001 (and for the urban cadastre still until today), no standards existed concerning obligatory elements or the necessary degree of precision for cadastral deeds. This resulted in documents similar to metes‐and‐bounds descriptions that often include vague expressions or relative references e.g. to neighbouring real estate. In order to facilitate error‐ and inconsistency‐checks as well as planning and decision‐making, the demand arises to visualise the textual information in maps. Existing programs for a transformation of metes‐and‐bounds descriptions already use additional logic to handle inconsistencies or missing information but are still rather limited in their abilities if too much uncertainty is incorporated in the text, i.e. corresponding maps to such texts are (if at all) only partially generated. Therefore, this article analysed whether or not all (even uncertain) of the spatial information in the descriptions can be transformed into a suitable map representation. This requires among other things a quantification of the qualitative expressions for lengths and directions that are used in the texts.},

	pages={165-175},
	abstract={Considerable effort has been devoted over the years to fighting uncertainty in geographic information in its different manifestations. Thus far, research on handling inaccuracy, fuzziness, error and related issues has focused for the most part on problems with spatial data and their direct products, typically representations of spatial objects or fields. This paper seeks to broaden the discussion of uncertainty in the geospatial domain by shifting the focus from information to knowledge. It turns out that there is a surprising number of things that we cannot know (or questions we cannot answer) that are not the result of imperfect information. Forms of not knowing are pervasive in domains as diverse as mathematics, logic, physics, and linguistics, and are apparently irreducible. This being the case it may help to explore how these realms of ignorance may affect our efforts. The paper distinguishes three different modes or forms of geospatial knowledge production, and argues that each of them has built–in imperfections, for reasons of logical principle and not just empirical fact. While much can and needs to be done to manage and resolve uncertainties where possible, I argue for accepting that uncertainty is an intrinsic property of complex knowledge and not just a flaw that needs to be excised.},

	abstract={Spatial interpolation is an important feature of a Geographic Information System, which is the procedure used to estimate values at unknown locations within the area covered by existing observations. In this paper, we describe a conservative spatial interpolation technique that incorporates the advantages of local interpolation, Euclidean interpolation, and conservative fuzzy reasoning, and a dynamic fuzzy–reasoning–based function estimator with parameters optimised by a genetic algorithm. The main objective of this paper is to formulate a computationally efficient spatial interpolation technique similar to the IDWA technique that can be used in real time application. The main feature of our spatial interpolation technique is a capability for spatial interpolation and extrapolation in a higher–dimensional space. Examples from a rainfall spatial interpolation problem are used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed technique.},

	title={Analysis of land-cover transitions based on 17th and 18th century cadastral maps and aerial photographs},
	journal={Landscape Ecology},
	volume={16},
	number={1},
	pages={41-54},
	abstract={This paper explores the possibility of using non-geometric cadastral maps from the 17th and 18th century together with aerial photographs from 1945 and 1981 to analyse land-cover change in south-east Sweden. Habitats rich in plant species in the European rural landscape seem to be correlated with a long continuity of management. Accurate spatial data from historical data sources are fundamental to understand patterns of vegetation and biodiversity in the present-day landscape. However, traditional methods for rectification of non-geometric maps using corresponding points from orthophotos or modern maps are not satisfying, as internal inaccuracies will remain in the maps. This study presents a method to rectify the maps by local warping, thereby eliminating geometrical irregularities. Further, the land-cover changes were calculated and presented as transition matrices. The extent of arable fields and grasslands were analysed in relation to soil characteristics and continuity of management. The results show a dynamic relation between grassland and arable field, albeit the overall proportions remained almost the same between 17th and 18th centuries: 60% grassland to 32% arable field. The most substantial changes in land-cover were prior to 1945. Today there is 18% grasslands left in the study area, while 56% of the land-cover is arable field. Approximately 8% of present-day land-cover is semi-natural grassland 300 years of age or more. Compared to 300 years ago there is only 1% grassland left on peat and 2% on clay. In contrast, grassland covers associated with bare bedrock have been fairly stable in size. All semi-natural grasslands with a long continuity of management were situated on shallow soils, less than 50 cm depth. The major conclusions from this study are that (i) correctly rectified, old maps are very useful to address questions of land-cover changes in historical time, (ii) general trends in land use over 300 years in this hemi-boreal landscape seem to underestimate the full dynamics of land use change, and (iii) only a small proportion of the semi-natural grassland area had a 300 year continuity of management.},

	pages={235-253},
	abstract={The advent of high spatial resolution, multispectral satellite imagery has allowed analysis of remotely sensed images of urban land cover to become more useful to urban planning and decision making than in the past. The addition of radar imagery at relatively high spatial resolution (6 metres at best), with the advantages that it is not affected by cloud and diurnal light conditions and that it is sensitive to the target's geometric shape, surface roughness and moisture content offers additional capability in this regard. This paper incorporates analysis of Canadian RADARSAT‐1 and American Landsat TM satellite imagery and ground‐based GIS data to identify known pockets of urban poverty. Poverty is defined, based on a limited number of census variables related to dwelling construction materials and per household overcrowding. The objective is to provide a proof of concept that remote sensing data, especially from synthetic aperture radar, and ground‐based GIS data can be successfully integrated for urban planning purposes. The results suggest that the approach used is reasonable and that, with future refinement, it offers planners and decision makers a timely and cost effective means to locate and monitor poverty pockets in urban areas. This is especially important in large, rapidly urbanising areas in the developing world.},

	abstract={Historical maps possess a wealth of information that is, unfortunately, often unreachable by modern mapping applications. While the digitization of historical maps allows the information to be utilized in these applications, it is really, in many cases, the conversion of features (from a raster data type to a vector data type) contained on those maps that enables the information to be used more extensively and easily. This paper highlights the ways the University of Idaho Library enriched a thematic map to become more usable in modern mapping applications. We accomplished this by detailing a work flow within Esri ArcGIS for Desktop that takes advantage of image enhancement, geoprocessing tools, and remote sensing techniques to generate a vector data set from a raster image of a historical map. To a large degree, the general work flow developed can be adapted and utilized on similar thematic maps.},

	journal={International Journal of Geographical Information Science},
	volume={30},
	number={7},
	pages={1255-1280},
	abstract={The accuracy of old maps can hold interesting historical information, and is therefore studied using distortion analysis methods. These methods start from a set of ground control points that are identified both on the old map and on a modern reference map or globe, and conclude with techniques that compute and visualise distortion. Such techniques have advanced over the years, but leave room for improvement, as the current ones result in approximate values and a coarse spatial resolution. We propose a more elegant and more accurate way to compute distortion of old maps by translating the technique of differential distortion analysis, used in map projection theory, to the setting where an old map and a reference map are directly compared. This enables the application of various useful distortion metrics to the study of old maps, such as the area scale factor, the maximum angular distortion and the Tissot indicatrices. As such a technique is always embedded in a full distortion analysis method we start by putting forward an optimal analysis method for a general-purpose study, which then serves as the foundation for the development of our technique. Thereto, we discuss the structure of distortion analysis methods and the various options available for every step of the process, including the different settings in which the old map can be compared to its modern counterpart, the techniques that can be used to interpolate between both, and the techniques available to compute and visualise the distortion. We conclude by applying our general-purpose method, including the differential distortion analysis technique, to an example map also used in other literature.},

	journal={Political Geography},
	volume={40},
	pages={64-78},
	abstract={As Northern Ireland moves further from the period of conflict known as the 'Troubles', attention has increasingly focussed on the social and material vestiges of that conflict; Northern Ireland is still a deeply-divided society in terms of residential segregation between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists, and urban areas are still, indeed increasingly, characterised by large defensive walls, known as 'peacelines', which demark many of the dividing lines between the two communities. In recent years a body of literature has emerged which has highlighted the spatial association between patterns of conflict fatality and proximity to peacelines. This paper assesses that relationship, arguing that previous analyses have failed to fully take account of the ethnic complexity of inner-city Belfast in their calculations. When this is considered, patterns of fatality were more intense within the cores or 'sanctuaries' of highly segregated Catholic and Protestant communities rather than at the fracture zones or 'interfaces' between them where peacelines have always been constructed. Using census data at a high spatial resolution, this paper also provides the first attempt to provide a definition of the 'interface' in clear geographic terms, a spatial concept that has hitherto appeared amorphous in academic studies and media coverage of Belfast during and since the Troubles. In doing so it embodies both the material and demographic aspects of social division in Northern Ireland, and suggests an urgent need to reappraise the true role of these forms of social boundary in influencing patterns of violent conflict.},

	journal={International Journal of Housing Policy},
	volume={16},
	number={1},
	pages={1-30},
	abstract={This paper examines how ethnic segregation is connected to an ethnic division of the housing market and a spatial separation of different housing tenures in four Nordic cities. Explanations for the differences across the cities are found by comparing housing markets and housing policies. The housing markets are in all four cities ethnically segmented with high concentrations of immigrants in some forms of tenures (especially social/public housing) and low concentrations in others. We further discuss the reasons for the observed pattern. The paper shows that the spatial distribution of immigrants is strongly connected with the tenure composition of neighbourhoods. Ethnic divisions of housing tenures thus contributes to segregation, but the effect is much dependent on how tenures are distributed spatially. It is shown that ethnic segregation in three of the cities is connected to social housing, while cooperative housing is crucial in the fourth. It is also shown that a policy of neighbourhood tenure mix in one of the cities has resulted in a relatively low degree of segregation in spite of high concentrations of immigrants in social/public housing.},

	journal={Geographical Analysis},
	volume={41},
	number={4},
	pages={364-374},
	abstract={This article reflects on the principal statistical methodological issues that quantitative geographers addressed in the 1950s and 1960s. The source of many of these methodological problems lies in the assumptions of classical statistics that data are independent and identically distributed. The correlation inherent in spatial data recorded at nearby locations and the irregular nature of spatial frameworks are contrary to these assumptions and impact upon the use of both descriptive and inferential statistics. Most of the wider developments in statistics at that time still fell short of meeting the needs of statistical geographers. What emerged were statistical tests for pattern, nonmodel based but capable of being adapted to an irregular areal framework and certain other factors considered important in any particular spatial analysis. This article notes that, while spatial autocorrelation was presented as a “problem” for geographers, it is also important to realize that its presence can represent an opportunity. Este artículo reflexiona sobre los principales temas y problemas metodológicos en Estadística que fueron abordados por los geógrafos cuantitativos en las décadas de los 50 y 60. La fuente de mucho de estos problemas esta en dos supuestos de la Estadística clásica: los datos son independientes e idénticamente distribuidos. La correlación inherente entre datos espaciales ubicados en posiciones cercanas y la naturaleza irregular de los marcos (configuraciones) espaciales contradicen dichos supuestos y tienen impacto tanto en el componente descriptivo como en el inferencial del análisis estadístico. Mucho de los avances en estadística de aquellos tiempos no fueron suficientes para las necesidades de geógrafos cuantitativos. Lo que produjo esa época fueron tests/pruebas para medir patrones, no basados en modelos pero capaces de ser adaptados a un marco (configuración espacial) areal irregular y ciertos otros factores considerados importantes en cualquier análisis espacial. El artículo presente hace hincapié en que a pesar que la autocorrelacion espacial fue originalmente presentado como un ‘problema’ para los geógrafos, es igualmente importante indicar que su presencia también puede representar una oportunidad que puedes ser utilizada en otros tipos de análisis. 本文回顾了计量地理学家们在20世纪50‐60年代间应用统计方法时存在的主要问题。其主要根源在于经典统计学中对数据独立同分布的假设。空间数据中邻近位置间固有的相关性及空间结构中的不规则属性恰好与此假设相悖，进而影响到统计描述和统计推论的应用。当时，统计学上多数的大幅进展仍不能满足地理统计学家的需求，因而仅进行了未基于模型但适用于不规则分布结构的模式，以及在特定空间分析中的某些重要因子的统计检验。需要注意的是，虽然空间自相关对于地理学家作为一个“问题”而呈现的，但更重要的是要认识它的存在也代表了一种机遇。},

	abstract={The aim of this study is to examine the structure and dynamics of the burgher community in late 18th century Helsinki. The construction period of sea fortress Sveaborg, beginning in 1748 and lasting up until the Finnish War (1808- 1809), revolutionized the course of history for Helsinki. In the mid-18th century it was an economically menial small-town with some thousand inhabitants. On the eve of the Finnish War, Helsinki and Sveaborg formed an integrated twin town with nine thousand inhabitants and a blooming economy. Due to the fortress construction, Helsinki does not represent a typical Swedish town of that time. However, the fortress construction turned it into a typical representative of another common urban form: the early modern European military town. The development of the Helsinki burgher community was a mixture of national trends and features typical for an early modern military town. The most notable features are the contradictory developments of the groups of merchants and of lesser burghers, and the relations of the burgher community with the Sveaborg fortress. The fortification works helped the merchants to form a closed profession more efficiently than in most other towns, and thus helped the national trend forward; on the other hand, the lesser burghers, who were on the brink of extinction in most towns, survived and even strengthened in Helsinki by serving the military population. The structure and dynamics of the Helsinki burgher community explain why the town was the home of the most heated municipal power struggles in the late 18th century Swedish Realm, as despite their rapidly growing numbers, the lesser burghers had little influence on the town's politics. The burghers formed an integral part of the army maintenance, as they were expected to keep necessities for sale for soldiers to buy. However, due to geographical conditions, the burghers were unable to serve the military population of Sveaborg without settling to the fortress islands. This caused a series of conflicts between the army and the burghers, and finally resulted in the birth of a new kind of business circle that shattered the barriers between civil society and military society.}

	journal={Journal of Historical Geography},
	volume={37},
	number={4},
	pages={429-439},
	abstract={In this paper, interpretations of sustainable forestry are investigated against the historical background of transformations in the industrial utilisation of forests. Three distinct forest policy regimes in Finland since the 19th century are identified. First, the introduction of the German forestry model, with the central notion of sustained yield, and the establishment of the Finnish Forest Service took place simultaneously in the latter half of the 19th century. These actions aimed at changing patterns of local forest use considered detrimental to long-term forest utilisation. Second, a national forest sector was established during the 20th century. Industrial forestry was seen as a guarantee of economic independence for the new nation-state. Third, during a recent phase the influence of non-governmental organisations and international forest industry companies has increased, and traditional power relations have changed as issues such as biodiversity, forest certification and global investments have been introduced to the debates. It is concluded that the recent transformations in forest management should be read as transformations in industrial forestry rather than as abandonment of industrial forest use models; the legacy of the 19th century German forest science still prevails in forest management.

A major transformation of inter-urban exchange space is then enlightened, with new roads systematically privileged in the northern part of France and the largest cities, but avoiding mountains. They then study territorial integration processes on two different scales: the national, with the diffusion of hubs (characterized by a high betweenness centrality) all over French territory, and the regional, with the emergence of regional city-systems (modeled by a Reilly equation) in the northern part of France. The role of medium-sized cities as necessary links for connecting local and national scales is emphasized in most results.},

	abstract={This study adds to a growing body of research on the contextual determinants of marriage choice and provides new information on ethnic intermarriage in the late 19th century. Census microdata for 66 major cities in 1880 are used to estimate a multilevel model of assortative mating of I rish, G erman, and B ritish immigrants. Results demonstrate that marital choices made by individuals are significantly affected by the local urban context where they live. In addition, the very large disparity in endogamy between the B ritish and other groups can mainly be attributed to the smaller size of the B ritish population in these cities.},

	abstract={The census tract-based residential segregation literature rests on problematic assumptions about geographic scale and proximity. We pursue a new tract-free approach that combines explicitly spatial concepts and methods to examine racial segregation across egocentric local environments of varying size. Using 2000 Census data for the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we compute a spatially modified version of the information theory index H to describe patterns of Black-White, Hispanic-White, Asian-White, and multigroup segregation at different scales. We identify the metropolitan structural characteristics that best distinguish micro-segregation from macro-segregation for each group combination, and we decompose their effects into portions due to racial variation occurring over short and long distances. A comparison of our results with those from tract-based analyses confirms the value of the new approach.},

	volume={45},

	pages={489-514},
	abstract={This article addresses an aspect of racial residential segregation that has been largely ignored in prior work: the issue of geographic scale. In some metropolitan areas, racial groups are segregated over large regions, with predominately white regions, predominately black regions, and so on, whereas in other areas, the separation of racial groups occurs over much shorter distances. Here we develop an approach—featuring the segregation profile and the corresponding macro/micro segregation ratio—that offers a scale-sensitive alternative to standard methodological practice for describing segregation. Using this approach, we measure and describe the geographic scale of racial segregation in the 40 largest U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000. We find considerable heterogeneity in the geographic scale of segregation patterns across both metropolitan areas and racial groups, a heterogeneity that is not evident using conventional “aspatial” segregation measures. Moreover, because the geographic scale of segregation is only modestly correlated with the level of segregation in our sample, we argue that geographic scale represents a distinct dimension of residential segregation. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for investigating the patterns, causes, and consequences of residential segregation at different geographic scales.},

	number={1},
	pages={84},
	abstract={The study of population patterns has animated a large body of urban social research over the years. An important part of this literature is concerned with the identification and measurement of segregation patterns. Recently, emphatic calls have been made to develop measures that are better able to capture the geography of population patterns. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the application of the Q statistic, developed for the analysis of spatial association of qualitative variables, to the detection of ethnic clustering and exposure patterns. The application is to historical data from 1880 Newark in the United States, with individuals classified by ethnicity and geocoded by place of residence. Three ethnic groups, termed Irish, Germans, and Yankees, are considered. Exploratory analysis with the Q statistic identifies significant differences in the tendency of individuals and building occupancy to cluster by ethnicity. In particular, there is evidence of a strong affinity within ethnic clusters and some intermingling between Yankee and Irish residents. In contrast, the exposure of Germans to individuals of other groups is found to be more limited.},

	abstract={Investigating immigrant residential patterns in 1880 offers a baseline for understanding residential assimilation trajectories in subsequent eras. This study uses 100% count information from the 1880 Census to estimate a multilevel model of ethnic isolation and exposure to native whites in 67 cities for individual Irish, German and British residents. At the individual level, the key predictors are drawn from assimilation theory: nativity, occupation, and marital status. The multilevel model makes it possible to control for these predictors and to study independent sources of variation in segregation across cities. There is considerable variation at the city level, especially due to differences in the relative sizes of groups. Other significant city-level predictors of people's neighborhood composition include the share of group members who are foreign-born, the disparity in occupational standing between group members and native whites, and the degree of occupational segregation between them.},

	pages={1457-1477},
	abstract={To understand residential clustering of contemporary immigrants and other ethnic minorities in urban areas, it is important to first identify where they are clustered. In recent years, increasing attention has been given to the use of local statistics as a tool for finding the location of racial/ethnic residential clusters. However, since many existing local statistics are primarily developed for epidemiological studies where clustering is associated with relatively rare events, its application in studies of residential segregation may not always yield satisfactory results. This article proposes an optimisation clustering method for delineating the boundaries of ethnic residential clusters. The proposed approach uses a modified greedy algorithm to find the most likely extent of clusters and employs total within-group absolute deviations as a clustering criterion. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we applied it to a set of synthetic landscapes and to two empirical data sets in Auckland, New Zealand. The results show that the proposed method can detect ethnic residential clusters effectively and that it has potential for use in other disciplines as it offers an ability to detect large, arbitrarily shaped clusters.},

	abstract={Residential segregation is a multidimensional phenomenon that encompasses several conceptually distinct aspects of geographical separation between populations. While various indices have been developed as a response to different definitions of segregation, the reliance on such single-figure indices could oversimplify the complex, multidimensional phenomena. In this regard, this paper suggests an alternative graph-based approach that provides more detailed information than simple indices: The concentration profile graphically conveys information about how evenly a population group is distributed over the study region, and the spatial proximity profile depicts the degree of clustering across different threshold levels. These graphs can also be summarized into single numbers for comparative purposes, but the interpretation can be more accurate by inspecting the additional information. To demonstrate the use of these methods, the residential patterns of three major ethnic groups in Auckland, namely Māori, Pacific peoples, and Asians, are examined using the 2006 census data.},

	abstract={This paper proposes a new method for analyzing the segregation between point distributions. Though there have been proposed numerous methods and measures in segregation analysis, they have at least three deficiencies: (1) statistical significance of segregation is not evaluated, (2) detailed attributes of points are not considered, and (3) the relationship between different dimensions of segregation is not fully discussed. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a new method for analyzing the segregation between point distributions. We introduce a general procedure of evaluating the individual components of segregation. This procedure helps us find independent components of segregation and provides a means of assessing their statistical significance. It also permits us to take into account the detailed attributes of points in segregation analysis. To test the validity of the proposed method, we apply it to the analysis of synthetic and real datasets. The result supports the technical soundness of the method and provides empirical findings.},

This article reports the creation of a mapped public use dataset for EDs in ten northern cities for each decade from 1900 to 1930.

	abstract={Amsterdam's immigrants of Caribbean and southern Mediterranean origin have been characterized as modestly segregated from Dutch residents, and their residential assimilation has been expected to proceed rapidly. This article tests the hypothesis of spatial assimilation using both aggregate data on levels of segregation and individual-level analyses of the people who live in ethnic minority neighborhoods. Evidence is presented of assimilation for immigrants from the former colonies of Surinam and the Antilles, but Turks and Moroccans are shown to face stronger barriers. The former groups' higher standing favors their mobility from ethnically distinct neighborhoods. There is a generational shift for Surinamese and Antilleans, while the Turks and Moroccans born in Amsterdam are as likely as the immigrant generation to settle in ethnic minority neighborhoods.},

	abstract={America's changing color line is perhaps best expressed in shifting patterns of neighborhood residential segregation-the geographic separation of races. This research evaluates black exceptionalism by using the universe of U.S. blocks from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses to provide a single geographically inclusive national estimate (Theil's H) of black residential segregation from whites and other groups, which can be additively decomposed into its within (e.g., neighborhood segregation within places) and between components (e.g., racial differences between places). The results show that America's blacks are living in blocks that are roughly two-thirds less racially diverse than the U.S. population overall. Nationally, neighborhood segregation processes account for half, or even less, of blacks' segregation from whites, Hispanics and Asians. Declining big-city micro-segregation has been muted by increasing or persistent macro-segregation. Moreover, with growing neighborhood segregation in the suburbs and fringe, America's central cities-the focus of most previous studies-now account for only a minority share of all neighborhood or micro-level segregation between blacks and whites. Evidence of black incorporation or spatial assimilation must account for other levels of geography that extend beyond the traditional focus on neighborhood segregation in big cities.},

	abstract={Neighborhoods and neighborhood change are often at least implicitly understood in relation to processes taking place at scales both smaller than and larger than the neighborhood itself. Until recently our capacity to represent these multiscalar processes with quantitative measures has been limited. Recent work on "segregation profiles" by Reardon and collaborators expands our capacity to explore the relationship between population measures and scale. With the methodological tools now available, we need a conceptual shift in how we view population measures in order to bring our theories and measures of neighborhoods into alignment. I argue that segregation can be beneficially viewed as multiscalar; not a value calculable at some "correct" scale, but a continuous function with respect to scale. This shift requires new ways of thinking about and analyzing segregation with respect to scale that engage with the complexity of the multiscalar measure. Using block-level data for eight neighborhoods in Seattle, Washington, I explore the implications of a multiscalar segregation measure for understanding neighborhoods and neighborhood change from 1990 to 2010.},

Our study bridges scales, asking how the diversity and segregation patterns of metropolitan areas are influenced by shifts in the racial/ethnic composition of their constituent places. Drawing on 1980–2010 decennial census data, we use a new visual tool to compare the distributions of place diversity for 50 U.S. metro areas over three decades. We also undertake a decomposition analysis of segregation within these areas to evaluate hypotheses about the roles of different types of places in ethnoracial change. The decomposition indicates that although principal cities continue to shape the overall diversity of metro areas, their relative impact has declined since 1980. Inner suburbs have experienced substantial increases in diversity during the same period. Places with large white majorities now contribute more to overall metropolitan diversity than in the past. In contrast, majority black and majority Hispanic places contribute less to metropolitan diversity than in the past. The complexity of the patterns we observe is underscored through an inspection of two featured metropolises: Chicago and Dallas.},

	journal={Regional Science and Urban Economics},
	volume={47},
	pages={99-111},
	abstract={Abstract The spatial distribution of households of different socioeconomic groups in urban areas has drawn longstanding attention from scholars because residential location patterns have important impacts on social outcomes and the economic efficiency of cities. Recent comparative work on this topic has yielded some insight into the causes and consequences of segregation patterns, but much of this comparison is indirect. An explicitly spatial version of the entropy index has recently been developed that facilitates comparison, as it allows for the disaggregation of segregation levels by scale and income (Reardon and O'Sullivan, 2004; Reardon, 2009; Reardon and Bischoff, 2011). This paper applies these new measurement techniques to two metropolises; Hong Kong and San Francisco. Although overall segregation levels are similar, the shape of the segregation profile across geographic scales and the income distribution is quite different. The paper also includes a script for calculating spatial ordinal segregation indices in ArcGIS.},

Here a statistic is derived that explicitly incorporates the spatial relationships among the geographic parcels into the tabulation, a feature absent from the dissimilarity index and its competitors. This proximity statistic is compared with other indices and is found to be somewhat successful in distinguishing between single-cluster and multiple-cluster residential settlement patterns.},

	title={Implementing Spatial Segregation Measures in R},
	journal={PLoS One},
	volume={9},
	number={11},
	abstract={  Reliable and accurate estimation of residential segregation between population groups is important for understanding the extent of social cohesion and integration in our society. Although there have been considerable methodological advances in the measurement of segregation over the last several decades, the recently developed measures have not been widely used in the literature, in part due to their complex calculation. To address this problem, we have implemented several newly proposed segregation indices in R, an open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics, as a package called seg. Although there are already a few standalone applications and add-on packages that provide access to similar methods, our implementation has a number of advantages over the existing tools. First, our implementation is flexible in the sense that it provides detailed control over the calculation process with a wide range of input parameters. Most of the parameters have carefully chosen defaults, which perform acceptably in many situations, so less experienced users can also use the implemented functions without too much difficulty. Second, there is no need to export results to other software programs for further analysis. We provide coercion methods that enable the transformation of our output classes into general R classes, so the user can use thousands of standard and modern statistical techniques, which are already available in R, for the post-processing of the results. Third, our implementation does not require commercial software to operate, so it is accessible to a wider group of people.},

	abstract={Aggregated demographic datasets are associated with analytical and cartographic problems due to the arbitrary nature of areal unit partitioning. This article describes a methodology for generating a surface-based representation of population that mitigates these problems. This methodology uses dasymetric mapping and incorporates areal weighting and empirical sampling techniques to assess the relationship between categorical ancillary data and population distribution. As a demonstration, a 100-meter-resolution population surface is generated from U.S. Census block group data for the southeast Pennsylvania region. Remote-sensing-derived urban land-cover data serve as ancillary data in the dasymetric mapping. *The author would like to thank Cory Eicher and Alan MacEacren for many helpful conversations regarding dasymetric mapping and Barbara Buttenfield for her constructive comments on a previous draft of this article.},

	journal={Annals of the Association of American Geographers},
	volume={99},
	number={1},
	pages={27-48},
	abstract={This article explores statistical approaches for assessing the relative accuracy of medieval mapping. It focuses on one particular map, the Gough Map of Great Britain. This is an early and remarkable example of a medieval "national" map covering Plantagenet Britain. Conventionally dated to c. 1360, the map shows the position of places in and coastal outline of Great Britain to a considerable degree of spatial accuracy. In this article, aspects of the map's content are subjected to a systematic analysis to identify geographical variations in the map's veracity, or truthfulness. It thus contributes to debates among historical geographers and cartographic historians on the nature of medieval maps and mapping and, in particular, questions of their distortion of geographic space. Based on a newly developed digital version of the Gough Map, several regression-based approaches are used here to explore the degree and nature of spatial distortion in the Gough Map. This demonstrates that not only are there marked variations in the positional accuracy of places shown on the map between regions (i.e., England, Scotland, and Wales), but there are also fine-scale geographical variations in the spatial accuracy of the map within these regions. The article concludes by suggesting that the map was constructed using a range of sources, and that the Gough Map is a composite of multiscale representations of places in Great Britain. The article details a set of approaches that could be transferred to other contexts and add value to historic maps by enhancing understanding of their contents.},

	journal={Urban Studies},
	volume={30},
	number={7},
	pages={1151-1164},
	abstract={Summary. A variety of segregation measures have been proposed in the literature with the dissimilarity index and its variants being the most widely applied. While these measures provide a quick means of comparing segregation patterns across space and time, they are not linked to the processes that generate and maintain segregative patterns. This paper proposes a new method for measuring segregation. The method is based on comparative evaluations of neighbourhood characteristics as a determinant of spatial behaviour in cities.The proposed approach moves away from a purely geometric interpretation of segregation by anchoring the measurement of segregation into the actual urban setting.The method's main advantages are its responsiveness to changes in urban characteristics (e.g.spatial variations in rent increases), and changes in preference structures (e.g.a declining importance of distance as an impediment to relocation). A numerical example is used to demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed method against traditional segregation measures. The results indicate that the segregation experiences of minorities may be more severe than previously thought.}

This article illustrates these integrative possibilities through an exploration of political and social life in four 19th-century North American communities. Place of residence has been determined for approximately 80% of past inhabitants in each case study and spatial data serve as the link for all information. GIS provides a new variable—spatial relationships—of interest to both political and social historians. GIS employed in this type of ``total history'' adds value for its analytic capacities as well as its more familiar strengths in visualization. GIS in this way is returned to the narrative and placed at the center of the interests of both political and social history.},

	pages={103-122},
	abstract={Archaeological, historical, and ethnographic research has demonstrated how mountainous environments influence the socio-cultural dynamics of the communities that live in them and in their neighbouring areas. The development of these communities tends to occur at the margins, often far away from centres of political power. This marginality is also extended to movement in these regions, where mountain ranges regularly constitute mighty obstacles on account of their natural configuration which plays a central role in strategy, commerce and travelling. In the case of western Sierra Morena in Spain, its constitution shaped both the ways of transit through the mountains during Later Prehistory and the historical routes of communication that traverse Andalucía. Using a GIS methodology developed specifically to identify particular characteristics of the landscape relevant to human movement, such as passageways, crossing points, and natural areas of transit, we examine the role that natural accessibility had for the late prehistoric societies of this region. We conclude that the location of their habitats and symbolic places are strongly related to corridors, possibly due to an increasing importance of herding activities. Investigaciones arqueológicas, históricas y etnográficas han demostrado como los ambientes de montaña tienen una profunda influencia en las dinámicas socioculturales de las comunidades que viven en ellos y en sus áreas vecinas. El desarrollo de estas sociedades tiende a producirse en los márgenes, usualmente lejos de los centros de poder político. Esta marginación se extiende también a la circulación en estas regiones, donde las cordilleras suelen constituir poderosos obstáculos debido a su configuración natural que juega un papel central en sus estrategias, comercio y movimiento humano. Durante la Prehistoria Reciente, la constitución de Sierra Morena Occidental (España) moldeó tanto las vías de tránsito a través de las montañas, como las rutas históricas de comunicación que atraviesan Andalucía. Utilizando una metodología de Sistemas de Información Geográfica diseñada específicamente para identificar características en el paisaje de particular relevancia para el movimiento humano (como corredores naturales, puntos de cruce y áreas naturales de tránsito), se examinó el papel que la accesibilidad del terreno tuvo para las comunidades de esa región durante la Prehistoria Reciente. Mediante este análisis concluimos que la ubicación de sus hábitats y lugares simbólicos se encuentran estrechamente relacionados con corredores naturales, posiblemente debido a una creciente importancia de las actividades de pastoreo.},

	journal={Fennoscandia archaeologica},
	volume={29},
	pages={73-91},
	abstract={Abstract When founded in 1621, Tornio was the northernmost town in Europe. The founding of Tornio was part of a larger urbanization boom in the Kingdom of Sweden which established itself as a northern European great power in the early 17th century. This paper discusses the meanings of, and the townsfolk's relationship with the urban landscape of Tornio in the 17th and 18th century, focusing especially on the links between local identity and spatial and built forms. The paper emphasizes the role of local traditions and ways of life for understanding continuities and changes in the ur- ban landscape of Tornio. On the other hand, however, the reorganization of urban space and the development of urban cartography reﬂect attempts by the Swedish Crown to tighten its control over the development of towns around the Gulf of Bothnia. Various aspects of this mixing of local traditions and the Crown's interests will be considered in the paper.}

Yet, results of our literature review, including more than 10,000 articles published in 15 journals from January 2001 and December 2010, indicate that Bayesian approaches are essentially absent from the organizational sciences. Our article introduces organizational science researchers to Bayesian methods and describes why and how they should be used. We use multiple linear regression as the framework to offer a step-by-step demonstration, including the use of software, regarding how to implement Bayesian methods. We explain and illustrate how to determine the prior distribution, compute the posterior distribution, possibly accept the null value, and produce a write-up describing the entire Bayesian process, including graphs, results, and their interpretation. We also offer a summary of the advantages of using Bayesian analysis and examples of how specific published research based on frequentist analysis-based approaches failed to benefit from the advantages offered by a Bayesian approach and how using Bayesian analyses would have led to richer and, in some cases, different substantive conclusions. We hope that our article will serve as a catalyst for the adoption of Bayesian methods in organizational science research.},

The author examined the distribution of imperial lifetimes using a data set that spans more than three millennia and found that it conforms to a memoryless exponential distribution in which the rate of collapse of an empire is independent of its age. Comparing this distribution to similar lifetime distributions of other complex systems-specifically, biological species and corporate firms-the author explores the reasons behind their lifetime distributions and how this approach can yield insights into empires.},

	journal={Landscape Research},
	volume={27},
	number={2},
	pages={141-166},
	abstract={A methodology is proposed for systematic map assessment to contribute to landscape-change research. Two major topic areas are dealt with, namely: content, quality and usefulness of landscape information on different maps; and methods used in the spatial conversion of maps into digital systems (e.g. geographical information systems). The major focus is on information about physical landscape characteristics (e.g. land cover) and land uses. The approach was tested using a sequence of nine large- and medium-scale basic maps of the island of Ruissalo in SW Finland from between 1690 and 1998. Fundamental differences were found in the thematic consistency of landscape information, mainly related to the scale, purpose and generalization of landscape information on different maps. Spatial matching was tested for a set of three old maps using four image rectification functions. The results showed that spatial matching of old maps is difficult, and success in rectification is influenced by many factors. Evaluation and selective transformation of landscape information from maps and the use of supportive information from other sources can assist in landscape-change analysis based on map sequences.},

I present an evaluative strategy grounded in  the  ﬁeld  of  social  informatics  referred  to  as  socio-technical  interaction networks (STIN) approach. The central tenet of this analytical approach is that it models the context of humanities scholars' routine engagement with digital technologies as a sociotechnical network-a web of relationships of technological and social elements. Using qualitative data collected from multiple sources I demonstrate the value of STIN as an analytical approach by analysing the assimilation and use of Geographical Information systems (GIS) by researchers studying historical topics. I conclude by identifying some of the core issues emerging from this study and how these issues can be useful to think about policy and strategy aspects related to digital humanities.},

	pages={311-335},
	abstract={Conducting temporal analysis of census data often requires applying areal interpolation to integrate data that have been spatially aggregated using incompatible zoning systems. This article introduces a method of areal interpolation, target‐density weighting (TDW), that is useful for long‐term temporal analysis because it requires only readily available historical data and basic geographic information system operations. Then, through regression analysis of a large sample of U.S. census tract data, a model is produced that relates the error in TDW estimates of tract population to four basic properties of tracts. An analysis of model residuals combined with theorized absolute limits on interpolation error yields formulas with which we can compute upper and lower prediction bounds on the population in a tract of one census at the time of a different census. These prediction intervals enable the interpretation of different interpolated estimates with appropriately varying degrees of uncertainty.},

	abstract={We estimate the effects of highways on the suburbanization of Spanish cities. Based on Spain's historical roads--the almost 2000 years old Roman roads and the 1760 Bourbon roads--we rely on an instrumental variables (IV) strategy because of the endogeneity of highway provision. Our results show that, first, each highway emanating from central cities caused an 8-9% decline in central city population between 1960 and 2011. Second, each highway ray fostered a 20% population growth in the suburbs, in particular in suburban municipalities where ramps were located. Finally, we confirm the increasing role of highways on shaping urban form: each additional kilometer closer to the nearest highway ramp increased municipal density growth by an 8%.},

	journal={Computers & Graphics},
	volume={35},

	pages={402-411},
	abstract={Old maps are increasingly used as a source for historical research. This is a consequence of the increased availability of old maps in digital form, of the emergence of user-friendly Geographical Information Systems, and of a heightened awareness of the unique information stored in old maps. As with every source for historical studies, when old maps are georeferenced and information is extracted for historical research, the accuracy and reliability of the geometric and semantic information must be assessed. In this paper, a method based on a series of geometric transformations is presented, which transforms control points of a modern reference map to the coordinate system of an old map. Based on these transformed points, the planimetric and geodetic accuracy of the old map can be computationally analyzed and various visualizations of space deformation can be generated. The results are graphical representations of map distortion, such as distortion grids or displacement vectors, as well as statistical and geodetic measures describing the map geometry (e.g., map scale, rotation angle, and map projection). The visualizations help to assess the geometric accuracy of historical geographical information before using the data for geo-historical studies. The visualizations can also provide valuable information to the map historian about the history of a particular map and its creation.},

The study is limited to models for the propagation of the disease in Sweden in 1350. Geographic data of S wedish water bodies and medieval road networks, historical data on the population in Swedish parishes, including their medieval boundaries, along with historical notes and disease characteristics, were used to build alternative models for spatial distribution. Three different models are presented: one radial, one cost‐based and one combining network analysis and radial propagation. Simulations were made to depict different scenarios on the spread of the disease, as well as the drastic changes in the overall population of S weden, over a couple of hundred years. For purpose of validation the population decrease estimated in each parish is compared with independent historical documents. Results from model scenarios are visualized in maps of propagation, animated video sequences and a web map service. Our analyses clearly demonstrate the power of spatial analysis and geographic information systems to describe, model and visualize epidemiologic processes in space and time.},

	abstract={The measurement of residential segregation patterns and trends has been limited by a reliance on segregation measures that do not appropriately take into account the spatial patterning of population distributions. In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index (P̃*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index (H̃), a spatial relative diversity index (R̃), and a spatial dissimilarity index (D̃). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index P̃*-which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments-and the spatial information theory index H̃-which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual-are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

Calibrated radiocarbon dates of the seeds of fat hen (Chenopodiaceae sp.) indicate animal husbandry around 1310 AD. Together with other finds, they indicate the existence of a large village community predating the masonry-built town of Viipuri. Also discussed are timber drainage structures of the 16th– 18th centuries. Finds of cannonball fragments and intact cannonballs can be associated with the siege of Viipuri in 1710, as a result of which the town surrendered to the forces of Peter the Great.

	journal={Fennoscandia archaeologica},
	volume={19},
	pages={37-64},
	abstract={In the summer of 1998, a new stage of archaeological investigations began in Viipuri. The work is conducted by the Vyborg (Viipuri) archaeological expedition of the Institute of History of Material Culture (St. Petersburg, Russia) under the leadership of PhD Aleksandr Saksa. During the \998-2001 field seasons, parts of the building sections of the town from different times were archaeo- logically investigated. This permitted  us to obtain new basic information about the urban culture of Viipuri (Sw. Viborg, Ru. Vyborg) in medieval and post-medieval times. This article discusses the main results ofthese archaeo- logical investigations. The history of the town is understood as the process of formation of an urban environment. The reasons, character and results of this development are discussed here with special reference to the results of recent archaeological research. We proceed from the archaeological material and investigate factors of change in material culture over the course of six centuries. The article is divided into a number of autonomous research topics: central research problems of the history of Viipuri castle and the early development ofthe town itself with emphasis on topographical features of the environ- ment,archaeologicalinvestigationsofthetownwallanditsbuildinghistory,thecharacteroftheculturallayerwith special regard to problems of chronology and the description of certain categories of the find material. Each of these should be a subject for further studies. Nevertheless, as a whole they illustrate different features of urban culture in its entirety. It is already possible to carry out comparable analyses of the finds with materials from other towns although in many respects this is a subject for future investigations. Thus, in this article we address a double task: on the one hand we present the main aspects of recently discovered archaeological materials from the latest field seasons, and on the other hand we phrase in precise terms the actual problems of research in urban culture, relevant in the present stage of studies concerning Viipuri. This is done on the basis of both well-known historical facts and new archaeological materials.}

	pages={505-541},
	abstract={The unique feature of geographic information systems (GIS) and other forms of historical data visualization is the capacity to hold and display large amounts of data associated with spatial reference points. This software can display all data for a given point, a single variable for all points, or, most important, any combination of variables across all reference points. In doing so, these systems bring to the screen instantly and cheaply a display of information once visible only in paper form, drawn slowly and expensively, first by cartographers and then by vector plotters. This project deploys GIS to help us understand the intersection of social and political life in nineteenth-century Alexandria, Virginia, and Newport, Kentucky—medium-sized cities with populations under 20,000. Commercial Alexandria, with a race-based labor system, and industrial Newport, with an immigrant labor system, present an analytically useful mix of commonalities and differences.},

	title={Past, present and future of historical information science},
	abstract={This report evaluates the impact of two decades of research within the framework of history and computing, and sets out a research paradigm and research infrastructure for future historical information science. It is good to see that there has been done a lot of historical information research in the past; much of it has been done, however, outside the field of history and computing, and not within a community like the Association for History and Computing. The reason is that the AHC never made a clear statement about what audience to address: historians with an interest in computing, or historical information scientists. As a result, both parties have not been accommodated, and communications with both ‘traditional’ history and ‘information science’ have not been established. A proper research program, based on new developments in information science, is proposed, along with an unambiguous scientific research infrastructure.}

	journal={Computers and Geosciences},
	volume={57},
	pages={124},
	abstract={When historical map data are compared with modern cartography, the old map coordinates must be transformed to the current system. However, historical data often exhibit heterogeneous quality. In calculating the transformation parameters between the historical and modern maps, it is often necessary to discard highly uncertain data. An optimal balance between the objectives of minimising the transformation error and eliminating as few points as possible can be achieved by generating a Pareto front of solutions using evolutionary genetic algorithms. The aim of this paper is to assess the performance of evolutionary algorithms in determining the accuracy of historical maps in regard to modern cartography. When applied to the 1787 Tomas Lopez map, the use of evolutionary algorithms reduces the linear error by 40% while eliminating only 2% of the data points. The main conclusion of this paper is that evolutionary algorithms provide a promising alternative for the transformation of historical map coordinates and determining the accuracy of historical maps in regard to modern cartography, particularly when the positional quality of the data points used cannot be assured.},

	journal={Geographical Analysis},
	volume={47},
	number={1},
	pages={34},
	abstract={Nearly all segregation measures use some form of administrative unit (usually tracts in the United States) as the base for the calculation of segregation indices, and most of the commonly used measures are aspatial. The spatial measures that have been proposed are often not easily computed, although there have been significant advances in the past decade. We provide a measure that is individually based (either persons or very small administrative units) and a technique for constructing neighborhoods that does not require administrative units. We show that the spatial distribution of different population groups within an urban area can be efficiently analyzed with segregation measures that use population count-based definitions of neighborhood scale. We provide a variant of a k-nearest neighbor approach and a statistic spatial isolation and a methodology (EquiPop) to map, graph, and evaluate the likelihood of individuals meeting other similar race individuals or of meeting individuals of a different ethnicity. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated in an application of the method to data for Los Angeles and three metropolitan areas in Sweden. This comparative approach is important as we wish to show how the technique can be used across different cultural contexts. The analysis shows how the scale (very small neighborhoods, larger communities, or cities) influences the segregation outcomes. Even if microscale segregation is strong, there may still be much more mixing at macroscales.},

	pages={343-360},
	abstract={This paper compares and contrasts alternative methods for the construction of discontinuous population surface models based on the census and remotely sensed data from Northern Ireland. Two main methods of population distribution are employed: (1) a method based on redistribution from enumeration district (ED) and postcode centroids, and (2) a method based on dasymetric redistribution of ED population counts to suitable land cover zones from classified remotely sensed imagery. Refinements have been made to the centroid redistribution algorithm to accommodate an empirical measure of dispersion, and to allow redistribution in an anisotropic form. These refinements are evaluated against each other and the dasymetric method. The results suggest that all of the methods perform best in urban areas, and that while the refinements may improve the statistical performance of the models, this is at the expense of reduced spatial detail. In general, the techniques are highly sensitive to the spatial and population resolution of the input data.},

Yet, global connectivity is not evenly distributed throughout the metropolis. As recent studies show, information-dependent businesses tend to concentrate in particular quarters in and around the City of London and the West End despite the spatial flexibility that modern telecommunication technology allows for. This study seeks to demonstrate how the modern ``digital divide'' that rips through London continuously evolved from similarly uneven connectivity patterns in the telegraphic network of late 19th-century London. With the help of historical Geographic Information Systems (GIS), these patterns will be visualized. This examination will show how important a role continuity played in the evolution of modern informational patterns and how this sheds new light on issues of technological dynamism and agency.},

	abstract={Abstract Interoperability is the main challenge on the way to efﬁciently ﬁnd and access spatial data on the web. Signiﬁcant contributions regarding interoperability have been made by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), where web service standards to publish and download spatial data have been established. The OGCs GeoSPARQL speciﬁcation tar- gets spatial data on the Web as Linked Open Data (LOD) by providing a comprehensive vocabulary for annotation and querying. While OGC web service standards are widely implemented in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and offer a seamless service in- frastructure, the LOD approach offers structured techniques to interlink and semantically describe spatial information. It is currently not possible to use LOD as a data source for OGC web services. In this paper we make a suggestion for technically linking OGC web services and LOD as a data source, and we explore and discuss its beneﬁts. We describe and test an adapter that enables access to geographic LOD datasets from within OGC Web Feature Service (WFS), enabling most current GIS to access the Web of Data. We discuss performance tests by comparing the proposed adapter to a reference WFS implementation.}

	abstract={It is clear that both voluntary and involuntary forces normally contribute to the residential segregation existing between groups. For the most part, the contribution of each dimension has not been determined. Rather, researchers operate as if either one or the other force is operating. In the United States, for example, black-white segregation is assumed to be imposed by whites on blacks, as if the latter were themselves totally indifferent to the racial composition in their areas of residence. On the other hand, it is assumed that segregation between white ethnic groups is at present purely a voluntary matter. In an earlier period, it was assumed that their segregation was both voluntary (reflecting desires to be among compatriots) and involuntary (reflecting the imposition of restrictions on residential movement by other groups as well as economic forces). But it has not been possible for investigators to determine the relative importance of each factor. Using asymmetrical segregation indexes, a rudimentary procedure is proposed for determining the relative importance of voluntary and involuntary forces operating to generate a given level of segregation. Data based on Black, Anglo, and Spanish residential patterns are then considered in terms of the proposed model.},

	pages={296-310},
	abstract={Residential segregation is most commonly measured with the index of dissimilarity, an indicator that eliminates or at least minimizes the effect of group size. An asymmetric measure of isolation is described here, one which takes composition into account. Although it taps the same process in part, the measure provides a different way of approaching segregation and is found not to be a simple product of a composition variable coupled with the index of dissimilarity. Earlier conclusions about intercity differences and temporal changes in segregation between 1960 and 1970 are reconsidered. Centrain features of segregation are indicated that hitherto were unappreciated. Recognition of them yields some radically different conclusions about the segregation process, shifts over time, and differences among cities. The asymmetrical approach also explains why racial and ethnic groups have different perceptions about the magnitude of and the trends in segregation.},

	journal={Journal of Historical Geography},
	volume={48},
	pages={1-10},
	abstract={  Firewood played an indispensable role in European socio-economic systems from prehistory until the nineteenth century. Recent research has shown that in European temperate lowlands the most important management form to produce firewood was coppicing. In spite of the growing body of research on traditional woodland management, there remain large gaps in knowledge. Detailed studies of individual sites or smaller areas have provided a wealth of information on the methods of medieval coppicing, and at such sites the long-term effects of coppicing on vegetation structure and composition have also been examined. However, little is known about the distribution and extent of coppicing at the landscape scale, and forming a coherent picture of the spatial extent rather than the management details of coppicing in larger regions remains a challenge. This paper investigates the distribution and extent of coppice management in Moravia (eastern Czech Republic, ca. 22,300 km2) in the Late Middle Ages. We created an extensive database of written sources that contained information on the presence of coppice woods at the parish level. Subsequently we used the MAXENT algorithm to create a model of the distribution of coppicing over the entire area. With the help of wood production and consumption estimates, we also calculated the minimum area of managed woodland for the study period. Results show that coppicing was predominant in the lowlands and often occurred at higher elevations as well, where neither natural conditions nor tree species composition were favourable. The paper also highlights the potential of spatial models based on archival data for historical landscape reconstructions.},

	volume={110},
	number={34},
	pages={13886-13891},
	abstract={Individuals with insufficient nutrition during development often experience poorer later-life health and evolutionary fitness. The Predictive Adaptive Response (PAR) hypothesis proposes that poor early-life nutrition induces physiological changes that maximize fitness in similar environments in adulthood and that metabolic diseases result when individuals experiencing poor nutrition during development subsequently encounter good nutrition in adulthood. However, although cohort studies have shown that famine exposure in utero reduces health in favorable later-life conditions, no study on humans has demonstrated the predicted fitness benefit under low later-life nutrition, leaving the evolutionary origins of such plasticity unexplored. Taking advantage of a well-documented famine and unique datasets of individual life histories and crop yields from two preindustrial Finnish populations, we provide a test of key predictions of the PAR hypothesis. Known individuals from fifty cohorts were followed from birth until the famine, where we analyzed their survival and reproductive success in relation to the crop yields around birth. We were also able to test whether the long-term effects of early-life nutrition differed between individuals of varying socioeconomic status. We found that, contrary to predictions of the PAR hypothesis, individuals experiencing low early-life crop yields showed lower survival and fertility during the famine than individuals experiencing high early-life crop yields. These effects were more pronounced among young individuals and those of low socioeconomic status. Our results do not support the hypothesis that PARs should have been favored by natural selection and suggest that alternative models may need to be invoked to explain the epidemiology of metabolic diseases.},

In spite of the increase, taxable income differences within municipalities are still relatively small. It is clear, however, that incomes have risen more in areas of increasing population than in areas of declining population. The results also indicate that the smaller the areal unit used, the greater the income differences, and vice versa. Thus the results of analyses based on different areal units cannot necessarily be regarded as comparable.},

The first task is to identify the shape spaces in which such objects naturally live, and then to examine the probability structures induced on such a shape space by corresponding structures in Rm. Against this theoretical background one formulates and solves statistical problems concerned with shape characteristics of empirical sets of points. Some applications (briefly sketched here) are to archeology, astronomy, geography and physical chemistry. We also outline more recent work on "size-and-shape," on shapes of sets of points in riemannian spaces, and on shape-theoretic aspects of random Delaunay tessellations.},

	pages={3302},
	abstract={Investigations of Mediterranean connectivity have increasingly turned toward maritime landscape models to frame questions of seaborne exploration, marine resource exploitation, trade and exchange, and seafaring culture. Environmental and technological parameters are consistently acknowledged as crucial for understanding when and why different relationships developed across the sea, but their formal employment in the modeling and interpretation of maritime space remains quite limited. The methodology outlined here utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to integrate environment and technology as analytical tools for exploring the complexity of seaborne connectivity. Focusing on sailing days as practical units of distance and using an Archaic Greek shipwreck off Turkey as a case study, this preliminary model demonstrates how a more nuanced spatial approach can inform the human geography and socioeconomic structures of ancient maritime interaction.},

	abstract={The aim of this paper is to extend the range of current analytical procedures that archaeologists use to understand movement. In particular, how a landscape becomes ordered by simply defining a destination. More specifically, this study proposes the derivation of a focal mobility network, i.e. the network of most likely paths towards a given destination, and explores several of its applications within a landscape archaeology framework. The suggested extensions are based on existing standard procedures within most GIS. A series of synthetic control surfaces and an archaeological study focused around Iron Age hillforts in Galicia (NW Spain) are used as case studies to illustrate different analytical possibilities.},

	pages={122-134},
	abstract={Urban and planning historians frequently focus on inherently spatial topics such as migration, segregation, gentrification, and suburbanization and rely on historical maps as primary sources, but they rarely use geographic information systems (GIS) as a research method for analyzing spatial patterns. This article considers the reasons that GIS is not used more, including longstanding ambivalence about quantitative methods and limited training opportunities. It then outlines ways in which GIS can uniquely inform historical research—by emphasizing underlying spatial processes, making spatial patterns visible, and transforming mapping into a process—in ways that can refine and challenge existing urban historical narratives. Finally, recommendations for overcoming existing barriers to historical GIS are presented.},

	abstract={Historians may make misleading inferences from historical height data based on military records because before universal conscription many armies had minimum height requirements. Are some methods of allowing for the missing small soldiers better than others? Two decades of experience in working with such deficient height distributions yield strategies to use and to avoid in order to obtain robust estimates. The author concludes that the quantile bend estimator procedure is to be avoided, because the other procedures available-the Komlos-Kim method, truncated ordinary least squares regression, and truncated maximum likelihood regression-are more robust and appropriate. He demonstrates the consequences of the choices among those methods by showing that they determine whether height evidence implies that the early Industrial Revolution in England led to an improving or a declining standard of living.},

	abstract={A new occupational stratification scale, “HISCAM” (historical CAMSIS), has been developed to facilitate the analysis of data coded to the Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations. This article describes the derivation and properties of the HISCAM measure. The scale was derived using patterns of inter-generational occupational connections, replicating a method of “social interaction distance” analysis which is widely used in contemporary sociology. Analysis was performed on data for the period of 1800–1938, principally derived from marriage registers covering Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, and encompassing over two million inter-generational relationships. Researchers report how several different HISCAM scales were evaluated and show how this approach can explain social stratification and inequality in the past.},

	abstract={This is a reflective report of our historical GIS project on Beijing's urban culture during a culturally transitional and transformative period when the city operated not under direct political and ideological control by a supreme sovereign authority as the capital of an empire or an effectively unified nation-state. It is between the fall of the imperial order and before the Japanese occupation, 12 years before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. In this article, we will report what the project is about but we also have an underlying concern of what more GIS can tell us about historical Beijing as a city. This question will be addressed by drawing from the experience of our project. The article discusses the benefits gained and difficulties we encountered and our reflections upon a number of more fundamental theoretical issues. The scholarship contexts pertaining to the application of historical GIS to modern Chinese history and urban history are provided, against which a case of legal cultural development, especially that of the newly emergent legal profession, is discussed to illustrate in a spatial perspective the complex interplay between the legal heritage and transplants in Republican Beijing.},

	abstract={The census and similar sources of data have been published for two centuries so the information that they contain should provide an unparalleled insight into the changing population of Britain over this time period. To date, however, the seemingly trivial problem of changes in boundaries has seriously hampered the use of these sources as they make it impossible to create long run time series of spatially detailed data. The paper reviews methodologies that attempt to resolve this problem by using geographical information systems and areal interpolation to allow the reallocation of data from one set of administrative units onto another. This makes it possible to examine change over time for a standard geography and thus it becomes possible to unlock the spatial detail and the temporal depth that are held in the census and in related sources.},

	pages={76-91},
	abstract={The Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI) aims to build historical data sets from the 1911-1951 Canadian census manuscripts. To enhance the meaning of the microdata, and to enable users to apprehend the spatial dimension of the phenomena they study, the CCRI integrates as much geographical information as the census can provide and also provides users with resources to map selected data or the results they get. A framework to conduct basic or sophisticated spatial analyses is also provided. The integration of geographical information necessitates the reconstitution of the entire geography of census taking, as well as of census dissemination, through the first half of the twentieth century. The raw material of the census manuscript is organized according to enumeration areas, whereas the basic spatial unit of dissemination is the census subdivision listed in the published aggregate census returns. [Ed. Census bureau terminology (from 1911 to 1951) used census district and census subdistrict for the two basic spatial units for census taking as well as compilation and dissemination. Hereinafter, we will use the present-day terminology-census division and census subdivision-favored by the CCRI and Statistics Canada.] To spatially process and map the microdata as entered and the aggregate data as published, polygon files are being created for nearly 32,000 subdivisions and managed within a geodatabase. The files form the fundamental fabric to which microdata and aggregate data are both linked. The authors address the unexpected challenges that arise from the realities of historical census data and provide an overview of the limitations and the technical framework of the overall geographical component of the CCRI.},

In the last section, the new avenues opened by GIS to historical research and the difficulties that its application also involves are considered in the light of the evolution of historiography and of the experience of using databases in history. I argue that although the application of this tool in historical research represented an important innovation, GIS did not bring about a revolution in knowledge production in history. I also raise doubts about the notion of a spatial turn in this field. I finally suggest that the emphasis should be put, not on the technology, but on the historical problems.},

Use of algebraic results by Koerts and Abrahamse and theoretical results by Imhof, allows the authors to determine by numerical integration the exact distribution function of Moran's I for normally distributed variables. For the case in which the explanatory variables have been neglected, an upper and a lower bound can be given within which the exact distribution of Moran's I for regression residuals will lie. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is flexible enough to investigate related topics such as the characteristics of the exact distribution for distinct spatial structures as well as their different specifications, the exact power function under different spatial autocorrelation levels, and the distribution of Moran's I for nonnormal random variables.},

	abstract={We investigated the mechanism of epidemics with the impacts of climate change and socio-economic fluctuations in the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China (AD 1368-1901). Using long-term and high-quality datasets, this study is the first quantitative research that verifies the 'climate change → economy → epidemics' mechanism in historical China by statistical methods that include correlation analysis, Granger causality analysis, ARX, and Poisson-ARX modeling. The analysis provides the evidences that climate change could only fundamentally lead to the epidemics spread and occurrence, but the depressed economic well-being is the direct trigger of epidemics spread and occurrence at the national and long term scale in historical China. Moreover, statistical modeling shows that economic well-being is more important than population pressure in the mechanism of epidemics. However, population pressure remains a key element in determining the social vulnerability of the epidemics occurrence under climate change. Notably, the findings not only support adaptation theories but also enhance our confidence to address climatic shocks if economic buffering capacity can be promoted steadily. The findings can be a basis for scientists and policymakers in addressing global and regional environmental changes.},

This article shows how “exposure-based” or p* indexes of segregation may be generalized for analyses of the segregation of three or more groups, and demonstrates the application of the “generalized segregation index” in the Denver and Houston regions. Exposure-based segregation indexes measure the degree to which a group is geographically exposed to (or isolated from) other groups in neighborhoods. Exposure-based indexes are believed by many to be of somewhat greater relevance for fair housing policy than is the index of dissimilarity.},

	pages={833-851},
	abstract={This paper discusses a new measure of residential segregation by race that incorporates spatial proximity among neighbourhoods into the calculation of the index. The basis for the measure is the Gini index of segregation. Unlike other similar measures discussed in recent years, this measure satisfies the 'principle of transfers', is flexible enough to quantify a range of pre-specified spatial patterns of segregation and is easy to compute using spatial statistics software packages. The properties of the index are illustrated using several simple simulations and a case study of non-White-White segregation in Atlanta, Georgia. The application of the index in Atlanta suggests that spatial proximity among adjacent neighbourhoods has a large impact on overall levels of racial segregation.},

	journal={Landscape and Urban Planning},
	volume={75},
	number={3},
	pages={300-321},
	abstract={This paper presents a methodological synthesis of two congruent approaches into a common landscape change trajectory analysis and the assessment of landscape dynamics and sustainability. The emphasis of the analysis is on the retrospective relationship between the past and the present-day landscape patterns and associated key biotopes. The example key biotopes, oak woodlands and grasslands, represent valuable habitats in the hemiboreal landscapes of Finland and Sweden. The paper presents a conceptual stepwise approach for change trajectory analysis utilising multiple spatio-temporal data and techniques available in image processing and geographical information systems (GIS) including the following steps: (I) specification of spatio-temporal data and their representation of target objects, (II) the choice of direct or indirect change trajectory analysis, (III) hierarchical structuring of landscape information, (IV) compilation of landscape information into a GIS database, and (V) identification of paths for landscape change trajectory analysis. In this case study, we have focused on three interlinked trajectory analysis approaches, and their role in the assessment of landscape sustainability from a potential biodiversity perspective. We conclude that proposed landscape change trajectory analysis can improve the assessment of the key biotopes as well as present-day landscape characteristics, in maintaining biodiversity and related ecological values by providing information on landscape stability, continuity, change processes and boundary dynamics. This approach can be useful in the assessment of natural capital, but requires data-specific and context sensitive data processing and analysis solutions. The results should be interpreted as an approximation and generalisation of the spatio-temporal complexity of landscape reality and therefore be used in conjunction with additional habitat function measures.},

	abstract={This article answers the call for scholarship that models the implementation of geographic information systems (GIS) technologies in literary-historical research. Combining methods and perspectives from cultural history, literary studies, and geographic information sciences, the article confirms, challenges, and extends understanding of Victorian literary tourism in the English Lake District. It engages with the accounts of several nineteenth-century tourists, paying specific attention to Nathaniel Hawthorne's English Notebooks and Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley's A Coach Drive at the Lakes, which are examined alongside contemporaneous guidebooks and other commercial tourist publications. In the process, the article draws attention to a spatial correlation between the route of the Ambleside turnpike (the Lake District's principal coach road) and the major literary sites to which Victorian Lakeland visitors were guided. Recognizing this correlation, we contend, helps to deepen our appreciation of how the physical and imaginative geographies of the Lake District region interrelate. Specifically, it helps us appreciate how the Victorian fascination with the Lakeland's literary associations was modulated not only by interest in the region's other attractions, but also by material conditions on the ground.},

	pages={317-331},
	abstract={Through funding from the National Park Service's American Battlefield Protection Program, geographic information technologies were employed to create a high resolution, spatially accurate representation of the 1775 landscape of Boston's Inner Harbor and to conduct a geospatial and temporal assessment of the location, extent, and preservation potential of an American Revolutionary War battlefield and its associated cultural resources. Geographic information technologies provide the tools and methodologies to accurately create digital representations of historical landscapes. These tools enable the visualization and geospatial analysis of landscapes and significant historical events, greatly enhancing the understanding of temporal and spatial interactions between these events and the physical landscape upon which they occurred. Data sources include historical bibliographic and cartographic records, high resolution orthophotographs, constant value raster grids, and LIDAR data. A military terrain model was created utilizing American Battlefield Protection Program's KOCOA system categories, in order to identify defining features of the battlefield. KOCOA is an acronym which stands for Key terrain, Obstacles, Cover and Concealment, Observation and Fields of Fire, and Avenues of Advancement and Withdrawal. The KOCOA analysis provides an established method for identifying critical defining features of the battle and determining the influence of the landscape on the ephemeral battle events. The base map was created utilizing U. S. Navy Coast Survey maps dating from the mid-19th century. A digital elevation model was created to represent the 1775 topography, utilizing LIDAR data and constant value raster layers. The military terrain analysis provided valuable insights into battlefield events and decisions. Defining features of the battle were also identified and mapped. A detailed Environmental Systems Research Institute's ArcGIS Citation Data Model was used to link landscape and KOCOA features to the historical sources they were derived from. A comprehensive source table was created as part of this effort. The results of this investigation have provided a high resolution dataset of Boston's historical landscape during the time of the American Revolution. The geospatial analysis will aid in the development of long-range management strategies for the Chelsea Creek Battlefield and facilitate the assessment of threats to cultural resources posed by both anthropogenic activities and environmental change. The methodologies and interdisciplinary approach will also be applicable to other investigations seeking to recreate historical landscapes within a geographic information system.

	abstract={This article addresses several issues related to historical GIS data using a project studying the social culture of Republican Beijing as an illustration. For large-scale historical GIS projects, certain data layers or themes are fundamental to and provide the context for various types of investigation. We suggested that these data may be regarded as framework data, similar to the concept of the core dataset identified in the US National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) framework, but in a GIS project context. Due to various reasons, most historical GIS data always invite concerns about their quality. We discussed how typical spatial data quality concepts are partially applicable to historical GIS data. We also highlighted the data quality aspects that are more significant to historical than contemporary GIS data. Compiling high-quality historical GIS data is challenging. We used the data layer of temple locations as an example to illustrate the process of using a set of principles to resolve the inconsistencies of data from multiple sources to deal with location accuracy and data completeness problems. Two common but related quality concerns of historical GIS data are their relatively low spatial resolution and imprecise locations. The original population dataset of Republican Beijing suffers from these two issues. Using ancillary data, more precise population locations and population distribution at a higher resolution were estimated. Compilation of historical GIS data requires fusing data of different sources in order to enhance the quality of the data.},

	abstract={  The authors study the 30 insurgencies occurring between 1978 and 2008 using four methods crossing the qualitative/quantitative divide. The four approaches are narrative, bivariate comparison, comparative qualitative analysis, and K-medoids clustering. The quantification of qualitative data allows the authors to compare more cases than they could "hold in their heads" under a traditional small-n qualitative approach, improving the quality of the overall narrative and helping to ensure that the quantitative analyses respected the nuance of the detailed case histories. Structured data-mining reduces the dimensionality of possible explanatory factors relative to the available observations to expose patterns in the data in ways more common in large-n studies. The four analytic approaches produced similar and mutually supporting findings, leading to robust conclusions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract={Various spatial data sets of high quality and homogeneity allow a higher level of multidisciplinary research. The study is aimed at providing a clearer understanding of the technical and semantic aspects of the quality of historical maps, especially with respect to positional errors, through the georeferencing process. Georeferencing the system of historical map sheets with high precision over a large area is not easily incorporated into the less complicated standardised process. Significant problems may occur in rough mountainous regions, especially as many of the areas were not accessed at that time and therefore not surveyed. The standard process of georeferencing comprises mosaicking of singular map sheets to a seamless map, referencing with identical points, and applying an appropriate transformation method. The quality of georeferenced maps is assessed with statistical and visual parameters. The enhanced process additionally integrates descriptive (textual) information about the mapping processes, derivative georeferenced data sets as land use analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations. This approach allows a more detailed understanding of the quality and consequently improves a georeferencing process for any historical data sets. The First Military Survey maps of the Habsburg Monarchy (Josephine survey), produced between 1763 and 1787, were used as study data and the rugged Julian Alps of the Triglav National Park in Slovenia were employed as the study area.},

	journal={Demographic Research},
	volume={26},
	pages={633},
	abstract={The present paper analyses social differences in health among the elderly (60+) in the Sundsvall region in northern Sweden during the 19th century. We investigate whether social mortality differences are particularly apparent in old age when unpropertied groups lost their most important asset for survival: their capacity to work. The data, representing 9,535 fatal events, are analysed using a Cox regression model, assuming proportional hazards. Social class had no significant effect for women during the pre-industrial period, while only those with unknown social position had higher mortality among men. During the industrial period female mortality was lowest in the skilled working class and highest in the upper class. Social position was not significant for men in the full model. Urban mortality was 30% higher for women and 59% higher for men during the pre- industrial period compared to the peripheral parishes. The results lead us to question the accepted 'fact' of social health differences as a historical constant. Higher social position did not lead to better survival, and social differences in mortality did not increase in old age, despite the fact that the elderly were a highly vulnerable group. Instead, the spatial aspects of mortality were important, particularly during the pre-industrial period.},

One key contribution is the creation of historically accurate GIS maps showing the boundaries of enumeration districts in 39 major cities. These materials are now publicly available through a Web-based mapping system. Addresses of all households in these cities are also being geocoded, a step that will enable spatial analyses of residential patterns at any geographic scale.

	journal={World Archaeology},
	volume={33},
	number={3},
	pages={488-507},
	abstract={Understanding 'desertification', the ecological deterioration of arid lands into semi-deserts and deserts, is critical for the future well-being of the fifth of the world's population who inhabit drylands today. Many dryland regions now sparsely occupied by mobile or semi-mobile pastoralists have archaeological remains indicative of much more intensive systems of settlement and land use in the past, so archaeology has frequently been brought into debates about the respective roles of climate and people in causing desertification. While much of this work has been speculative and (in terms of modern ecological theory about drylands) rather simplistic, this paper presents a comparative study of Roman-period settlement and land use on the desert fringes of Roman Africa and Roman Arabia. The two regions provide contrasting histories of dryland farming that differed in terms of: their origins, development, and abandonment; the social and economic contexts of imperialism in which they functioned; farmers' perceptions of and responses to degradation; the scale of impact of land use on landscape; and the long-term success or failure of the strategies developed to manage processes of desertification. These very different trajectories illustrate how landscape archaeologists can contribute to understanding processes of desertification in the past, and to the desertification debate more generally.},

	abstract={Advances in geographic information systems (GIS) programs for both mapping and analysis make possible a new era of small-city studies. The author uses often-neglected tax records as a central part of the mapping process for two mid-nineteenth-century U.S. cities with populations of about 14, 000-Alexandria, Virginia, and Newport, Kentucky-that were respectively commercial and industrial in character. Approximately 80 percent of the inhabitants of these two cities in the nineteenth century have been relocated to their places of residence and associated-as individuals, families, and economic units-with all available social and political information. The result is an opportunity for a holistic analysis of two divergent cities representing key alternatives as the United States shifted from a rural to an urban nation.},

	abstract={The physical growth of cities is usually used to define the main direction of a city's development. This definition is key to understanding the city's current state and to plan for the future. Many urban planners agree that master plans should include historical urban growth and aim to specify the effective factors driving urban growth. However, defining urban boundaries and historical urban areas is a difficult task. The lack of satellite images, air photos, and real maps to use as base maps for historical urban studies is a problem that a researcher may face when determining patterns of urban development or conducting other analyses. In this article, the authors examine historical changes of the urban boundaries of the Ottoman city of Manisa. They analyze the physical growth of this large city by using the historical buildings (mosques, masjids, madrasas, baths, caravansary, and others) as markers.},

Discrimination between environmental and anthropogenic impacts on past civilizations, however, remains difficult because of the paucity of high-resolution paleoclimatic evidence. We present tree ring—based reconstructions of central European summer precipitation and temperature variability over the past 2500 years. Recent warming is unprecedented, but modern hydroclimatic variations may have at times been exceeded in magnitude and duration. Wet and warm summers occurred during periods of Roman and medieval prosperity. Increased climate variability from ∼250 to 600 C.E. coincided with the demise of the western Roman Empire and the turmoil of the Migration Period. Such historical data may provide a basis for counteracting the recent political and fiscal reluctance to mitigate projected climate change.},

	abstract={Investigation of pesticide impacts on human health depends on good measures of exposure. Historical exposure data are needed to study health outcomes, such as cancer, that involve long latency periods, and other outcomes that are a function of the timing of exposure. Environmental or biological samples collected at the time of epidemiologic study may not represent historical exposure levels. To study the relationship between residential exposure to pesticides and breast cancer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, historical records of pesticide use were integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate exposures from large-scale pesticide applications between 1948 and 1995. Information on pesticide use for gypsy moth and other tree/vegetative pest control, cranberry bog cultivation, other agriculture, mosquito control, recreational turf management, and rights-of-way maintenance is included in the database. Residents living within or near pesticide use areas may be exposed through inhalation due to drift and volatilization and through dermal contact and ingestion at the time of application or in later years from pesticides that deposit on soil, accumulate in crops, or migrate to groundwater. Procedures were developed to use the GIS to estimate the relative intensity of past exposures at each study subject's Cape Cod addresses over the past 40 years, taking into account local meteorological data, distance and direction from a residence to a pesticide use source area, size of the source area, application by ground-based or aerial methods, and persistent or nonpersistent character of the pesticide applied. The resulting individual-level estimates of relative exposure intensity can be used in conjunction with interview data to obtain more complete exposure assessment in an epidemiologic study. While the database can improve environmental epidemiological studies involving pesticides, it simultaneously illustrates important data gaps that cannot be filled. Studies such as this one have the potential to identify preventable causes of disease and guide public policies.},

	abstract={The Philippine "negrito" groups comprise a diverse group of populations speaking over 30 different languages, who are spread all over the archipelago, mostly in marginal areas of Luzon Island in the north, the central Visayas islands, and Mindanao in the south. They exhibit physical characteristics that are different from more than 100 Philippine ethnolinguistic groups that are categorized as non-negritos. Given their numbers, it is not surprising that Philippine negritos make up a major category in a number of general ethnographic maps produced since the nineteenth century. Reports from various ethnological surveys during this period, however, have further enriched our understanding regarding the extent and distribution of negrito populations. Using the data contained in these reports, it is possible to plot and create a map showing the historical locations and distribution of negrito groups. Using geographic information systems (GIS), the location and distribution of negrito groups at any given time can be overlaid on historical or current maps. In the present study, a GIS layer was compiled and extracted from the 2000 Philippine Census of population at the village level and overlaid on existing complement ongoing anthropological and genetic studies of negrito groups that inhabit different locations within the Philippine archipelago.},

	note={LR: 20141120; JID: 100967568; ppublish},
	abstract={Geographers play important roles in public health research, particularly in understanding healthcare accessibility, utilisation, and individual healthcare experiences. Most accessibility studies have benefited from the increased sophistication of geographic information systems (GIS). Some studies have been enhanced with semi-structured in-depth interviews to understand individual experiences of people as they access healthcare. However, few accessibility studies have explicitly utilised individual in-depth interview data in the construction of new GIS accessibility measures. Using mixed methods including GIS analysis and individual data from semi-structured in-depth interviews, we offer satisfaction-adjusted distance as a new way of conceptualising accessibility in GIS. Based on fieldwork in a predominantly lower-income community in Columbus, Ohio (USA), we find many residents felt neighbourhood healthcare facilities offered low-quality care, which suggested an added perceived distance as they attempt to access high-quality healthcare facilities. The satisfaction-adjusted distance measure accounts for the perceived distance some residents feel as they search for high-quality healthcare in lower-income urban neighbourhoods. In moving beyond conventional GIS and re-conceptualising accessibility in this way, we offer a more realistic portrayal of the issues lower-income urban residents face as they attempt to access high-quality healthcare facilities. The work has theoretical implications for conceptualising healthcare accessibility, advances the mixed-methodologies literature, and argues for a more equitable distribution of high-quality healthcare in urban neighbourhoods.},

	journal={The Professional Geographer},
	volume={66},
	number={2},
	pages={260-273},
	abstract={  The introduction of European livestock into the New World resulted in extensive land use changes. Studying the spatiality of these changes as they actually transpired in a three-dimensional landscape can enhance our knowledge of the environmental transformations that accompanied colonization. This article focuses on a case study area in New Spain, roughly equivalent to present-day Mexico, wherein forty-seven sheep ranches were established through viceregal land grants between 1535 and 1610. An integration of fieldwork, textual analysis of land grants, and imagery analysis enables these ranches to be mapped in a three-dimensional geographic information system (GIS) environment. Once mapped in a GIS, the spatial statistics of each ranch's elevation, slope, and aspect (slope orientation) can be calculated to identify spatio-temporal patterns of land use change. These spatio-temporal patterns can be interpreted within the highly localized contexts of land granting to amplify our understanding of human-environment interaction in New Spain. This article's key findings are that grantees harbored a persistent preference for south-facing land; ranches clustered most heavily on isolated elevations; viceregal ordinances were effective at keeping livestock away from low-lying, agriculturally productive zones; and, as a consequence of native population decline and forced native resettlements, the midelevations experienced a land use change from semiterraced agriculture to ranching. These results offer a fresh perspective on the local-scale processes of land use change that resulted from the European colonization of the New World. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract={Making effective use of digital texts is one of the major challenges facing the humanities. This article explores a novel method of using a large corpus of British newspapers to help explain why three neighboring rural districts in England showed very different patterns of infant mortality decline in the second half of the nineteenth century. Quantitative analysis does not reveal any major differences between these districts that might explain this. Repeatedly querying the corpus using different combinations of search terms and place-names, the authors show significant differences in the quality of local government between these districts. They argue that place-centered reading, as they term this approach, can be used to help explain patterns found using conventional quantitative geographical information systems (GIS) approaches.},

	abstract={  Research benefits a great deal when different kinds of registers can be combined. Record linkage is an important tool for connecting sources to create longitudinal databases of individual data. In this article, researchers test and evaluate different methods of record linkage used when linking two censuses. By comparing the results of the census linkage with other continuous Swedish parish registers, they find that applying constructed name variables and household links considerably increases the success rate without the risk of introducing bias. Missing links are mainly related to name problems, and appear most frequently among children and when the family structure has changed between the censuses. Faulty links are very few and must be regarded as only a marginal problem for analysis. The study underlines the importance of adapting the linkage process to the special characteristics of the sources.},

	number={4},
	pages={180-189},
	abstract={This article presents new evidence on the evolution of regional inequality in Iberia from 1900 to 2000 from a geographical perspective. To do so we introduce a new historical dataset of regional gross domestic products (GDPs) for Spanish NUTS III and Portuguese Historical Districts, synthetic indices of regional inequality, and different measures of spatial correlation across regional per capita GDPs. The results show that the Portuguese and Spanish national economic integration processes initially led to the economic specialization across Iberian regions promoting the divergence in terms of their regional per capita GDPs. Notwithstanding, ulterior advances in the integration of national markets and the subsequent first stages in the process of adhesion of these two national economies into the UE coexisted with a progressive reduction in Iberian regional inequality.},

	abstract={As a valuable source for historical research, cadastral maps have been useful in historical Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research. This article takes the cadastral maps of the French Concession in Shanghai (1931-1941) as an example to reconstruct the spatial distribution and changes of landowners' real estate, tracking nationalities, land value and parcel splitting/merging, and to explore the spatial correlation with the population, commercial shops and land value by combining the socio-economic data during this period. We argue that the use of a data-enriched historical cadastre offers a unique vantage point to understand the spatial and economic dynamics at work in the French Concession. This example highlights the need for accurate and integral historical data and how these play a decisive role in the process of the historical reconstruction in historical GIS.},

	journal={Annals of the Association of American Geographers},
	volume={98},
	number={4},
	pages={773-794},
	abstract={This article presents a substantive analysis using the Great Britain Historical Geographical Information System (GIS), one of the earliest national historical GISs. It develops exploratory techniques to explore local patterns of demographic change and applies these to the study of infant mortality in England and Wales from 1851 to 1911. The techniques developed could be applied to a wide variety of fields where the aim is to explore long-term spatio-temporal change using data published for administrative units that are affected by boundary changes. The Victorian and Edwardian eras saw the origins of the sustained infant mortality decline that characterized the entire twentieth century. Although the period has been extensively studied for a century and more, our knowledge of this vital phase is still surprisingly limited. In particular, much of the research to date has focused on urban areas and has thus stressed urban explanations as to why infant mortality began to decline. Because this article uses a comprehensive GIS database, we are able to challenge some of the orthodoxies that have emerged. It reveals that patterns of infant mortality decline in different parts of the country were more complex than has previously been described. Far from the national rate being driven by changes in urban areas, the largest declines and earliest declines in infant mortality were found in rural parts of the southeast of England, as the rural periphery lagged far behind. Urban areas were slow to decline due to the specific conditions that existed in them in this period.},

	pages={2423-2437},
	abstract={Kernel smoothing is routinely used for the estimation of relative risk based on point locations of disease cases and sampled controls over a geographical region. Typically, fixed-bandwidth kernel estimation has been employed, despite the widely recognized problems experienced with this methodology when the underlying densities exhibit the type of spatial inhomogeneity frequently seen in geographical epidemiology. A more intuitive approach is to utilize a spatially adaptive, variable smoothing parameter. In this paper, we examine the properties of the adaptive kernel estimator by both asymptotic analysis and a simulation study, finding advantages over the fixed kernel approach in both the cases. We also look at practical issues with implementation of the adaptive relative risk estimator (including bandwidth choice and boundary correction), and develop a computationally inexpensive method for generating tolerance contours to highlight areas of significantly elevated risk.},

	journal={Cartographica: The International Journal for Geographic Information and Geovisualization},
	volume={36},
	number={4},
	pages={11-22},
	abstract={Michael Goodchild, a prominent GIS researcher, responded to Taylor in the next issue of Political Geography Quarterly (1991a). Rather than extolling the virtues of GIS, Goodchild argued that, while the technological structure of GIS is controlled by computer science, the development of GIS in geography has led to the realization that databases and processes can be inaccurate. He suggested that GIS has made its own limitations an integral part of its research for decades (1991a, 336). Furthermore, he argued, GIS is most useful precisely when it is "guided by people trained in the nature of geographical phenomena," that GIS is designed to be used in conjunction with knowledge rather than a substitute for it. GIS without geography, Goodchild implied, is indeed a naive and dangerous empiricism. Against Taylor's assertion that GIS is the "positivists' revenge" (1990, 212), Goodchild differentiated GIS from quantitative geography, pointing to the "fuzziness and generalization" involved in cartography. He did ask, nevertheless, whether positivism doesn't have some uses in the social sciences. This possibility, according to Goodchild, makes GIS not a "mere tool" but, rather, a means of provoking "profound geographical thoughts" (336). Taylor's was not the only reply to Openshaw in Environment and Planning A. Gordon Clark, in a commentary entitled "GIS - What Crisis?" berated both parties. He acknowledged that Openshaw was provoked by Taylor's initial critique of GIS, which, he implied, was inspired by the (reputed) disdain of some "postmodernists" for "knowledge and reason" (Clark 1992, 321). But rather than brand all alleged postmodernists as anti-GIS, Clark conducted an informal poll of his "postmodernist" friends, only to find them uniformly enthusiastic about GIS technology. Their fears revolved around insufficient staffing in GIS rather than a disciplinary coup. His conclusion was that Openshaw had "exaggerated the hostility to GIS" (Clark 1992, 321) while correctly identifying an inexorable trend toward cybernetic systems. Clark's major contribution to discussions of GIS, however, lay in identifying that GIS is not only a (sub) discipline but also an industry. Clark suggested that the proliferation of commercial interests in GIS threatens the type of "blue-sky" research that universities conduct, research that, despite its underlying reliance on representational realism, endeavours to model the world more precisely. Clark concluded that "it is going to become crucial for universities to identify some comparative advantage in the GIS market not easily penetrated by commercial companies" (1992, 322). From this perspective, squabbles within geography lose relevance, overshadowed by commercial influences driving the technology. Initiative 19: The Social Implications of How People, Space, and Environment are Represented in GIS was sponsored by the NCGIA, itself funded by the National Science Foundation. The NCGIA was initially created to support "a center for the advancement" of GIS, but it has since expanded its mission to entail "advanced geographic research" (Goodchild and Mark 1993, 219). Shifts in the goals of the NCGIA reflect recognition that GIS and geography are inseparable. The 119 steering committee, approved in 1995, was a mix of social geographers and GIS scholars; their first meeting was held in early 1996. As a consequence of promoting disciplinary space for GIS and its critics to work together on issues relating to "GIS and society," Initiative 19 marked the beginning of publications more moderately critical of GIS. These essays were far more invested in the continuation of GIS, while remaining sensitive to its repercussions (Curry 1997; Pickles 1997, 1999). I19 created an environment that fulfilled one condition for shared communities of interest: mutual dependence. The Initiative further shifted the relationship between critics and GIS researchers as it somewhat integrated the former into the institutional body of the NCGIA. In the process, critiques of GIS were both legitimated and incorporated. Among the repercussions of this shift in critiques of GIS was recognition that (1) GIS is a permanent feature in the geography landscape; (2) the agency with which to resist the potentially destructive implications of GIS technology (military and surveillance) could be fostered; and (3) the success of critics as well as advocates of GIS depended on its continuation. The Initiative itself was a formalization of the intimation by critics of GIS that technology is always and irrevocably a social process. Its institutional home (the NCGIA) is, however, notably aligned with scientific endeavour.},

	journal={Cityscape},
	volume={17},
	number={1},
	pages={97},
	abstract={  Segregation involves more than one population group, and segregation measures quantify how different population groups are distributed across space. One of the key conceptual and methodological foundations of segregation studies is to account for the potential of spatial interaction among two or more population groups across areal units. This foundation implies the need for a spatial approach to portray the spatial (and thus social) interaction among neighbors. In general, simple percentages (for example, percent Black) are not a measure of segregation. Because local spatial segregation measures did not emerge until recently, the objectives of this article are threefold: (1) to explain a spatial approach for measuring the level of segregation at the neighborhood (or local) level, (2) to demonstrate the deficiencies of using a percentage of racial/ethnic group as a measure of segregation, and (3) to clarify the appropriateness of two commonly used indexes of dissimilarity and diversity. Data from St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois, are used to discuss these three points.},

	journal={International journal of health geographics},
	volume={9},
	number={1},
	pages={29},
	abstract={Racial residential segregation is hypothesized to affect population health by systematically patterning health-relevant exposures and opportunities according to individuals' race or income. Growing interest into the association between residential segregation and health disparities demands more rigorous appraisal of commonly used measures of segregation. Most current studies rely on census tracts as approximations of the local residential environment when calculating segregation indices of either neighborhoods or metropolitan areas. Because census tracts are arbitrary in size and shape, reliance on this geographic scale limits understanding of place-health associations. More flexible, explicitly spatial derivations of traditional segregation indices have been proposed but have not been compared with tract-derived measures in the context of health disparities studies common to social epidemiology, health demography, or medical geography. We compared segregation measured with tract-derived as well as GIS surface-density-derived indices. Measures were compared by region and population size, and segregation measures were linked to birth record to estimate the difference in association between segregation and very preterm birth. Separate analyses focus on metropolitan segregation and on neighborhood segregation. Across 231 metropolitan areas, tract-derived and surface-density-derived segregation measures are highly correlated. However overall correlation obscures important differences by region and metropolitan size. In general the discrepancy between measure types is greatest for small metropolitan areas, declining with increasing population size. Discrepancies in measures are greatest in the South, and smallest in Western metropolitan areas. Choice of segregation index changed the magnitude of the measured association between segregation and very preterm birth. For example among black women, the risk ratio for very preterm birth in metropolitan areas changed from 2.12 to 1.68 for the effect of high versus low segregation when using surface-density-derived versus tract-derived segregation indices. Variation in effect size was smaller but still present in analyses of neighborhood racial composition and very preterm birth in Atlanta neighborhoods. Census tract-derived measures of segregation are highly correlated with recently introduced spatial segregation measures, but the residual differences among measures are not uniform for all areas. Use of surface-density-derived measures provides researchers with tools to further explore the spatial relationships between segregation and health disparities.},

Integration is normally interpreted by geographers as a straddling of the environmental-social divide, but a more profound interpretation stresses the issues involved in coupling environmental and social processes: a science of integration rather than an integration of sciences. Seven examples of distinct data types and scientific questions are examined, leading to the conclusion that a space-time geographic information system is unlikely to emerge in the near future. Instead, attention should focus on the systematic study of the issues involved in integration through the formal environment of a computational system. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	title={Bayesian Statistics},
	abstract={Bayesian Statistics is the school of thought that combines prior beliefs with the likelihood of a hypothesis to arrive at posterior beliefs. The first edition of Peter Lee's book appeared in 1989, but the subject has moved ever onwards, with increasing emphasis on Monte Carlo based techniques. This new fourth edition looks at recent techniques such as variational methods, Bayesian importance sampling, approximate Bayesian computation and Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), providing a concise account of the way in which the Bayesian approach to statistics develops as well as how it contrasts with the conventional approach. The theory is built up step by step, and important notions such as sufficiency are brought out of a discussion of the salient features of specific examples. This edition: Includes expanded coverage of Gibbs sampling, including more numerical examples and treatments of OpenBUGS, R2WinBUGS and R2OpenBUGS. Presents significant new material on recent techniques such as Bayesian importance sampling, variational Bayes, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). Provides extensive examples throughout the book to complement the theory presented. Accompanied by a supporting website featuring new material and solutions. More and more students are realizing that they need to learn Bayesian statistics to meet their academic and professional goals. This book is best suited for use as a main text in courses on Bayesian statistics for third and fourth year undergraduates and postgraduate students.},

	abstract={This paper contributes to the archaeological study of movement in urban environments where built forms and natural features worked together to play a key role in structuring human mobility. We propose an analytical method using least cost analysis in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to empirically measure social integration. The method deﬁnes mobility as the potential for pedestrian movement, and identiﬁes locations where people were most likely to walk to or through in a landscape. The calculated mobility data are then employed to identify with whom people were most likely to interact and the degree to which they were socially connected with particular groups of society (social networks), and integrated  within  society  as  a  whole.  The  results  reveal  underlying  spatial  complexities  that  in conjunction with other archaeological data can be correlated to social, political, or economic inequality in ancient cities. We apply the method to measure social integration between four socioeconomic groups at the Late Classic (AD 600e900) Maya city of Copán, Honduras. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	journal={Journal of Archaeological Science},
	volume={39},
	pages={347-356},
	abstract={The study of material culture generated by military engagements has created an emergent sub-discipline of archaeological studies centred on battleﬁelds. This approach has developed a particular and sophis- ticated methodology that is able to deal with the fact that archaeologists will often not ﬁnd either structures or a useful stratigraphical record on the site, as the material remains of the battle will basically be metallic objects carried by combatants. It is therefore rather complicated not only to test hypotheses about battle events based on archaeological data, but also to validate the methodology used. Here we propose  the  use  of  agent-based  models  to  explore  these  issues  in  the  case  of  eighteenth-century battleﬁeld archaeology. The simulation is divided into four different steps. Firstly, a battle is simulated in order to generate realistic virtual archaeological remains left by an engagement between two armies of this era. We then simulate the loss of information that the passing of time produces in the battleﬁeld. The third step involves simulating the archaeological survey, enabling us to explore different survey strategies and the impact on the interpretation of the event itself. Finally, we design a conﬁdence index in order to compare the results of the different virtual excavations using spatial analysis and statistics. The results show that the methodology is fully functional in terms of understanding a battle, and it allows us to suggest new strategies to improve ﬁeldwork and to develop new ways of exploring these particular archaeological sites. It is concluded that the described approach illustrates how simulation can be used to explore methodological issues of archaeological science. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	journal={Journal of Experimental Psychology},
	volume={142},

	pages={573-603},
	abstract={One of the most frequently encountered scientific procedures is a comparison of two groups (e.g., du Prel, Ro¨ hrig, Hommel, & Blettner,  2010;  Fritz,  Morris,  &  Richler,  2012;  Wetzels  et  al., 2011). Given data from two groups, researchers ask various com- parative questions: How much is one group different from an- other? Can we be reasonably sure that the difference is non-zero? How certain are we about the magnitude of difference? These questions are difficult to answer because data are contaminated by random variability despite researchers' efforts to minimize extra- neous  influences  on  the  data.  Because  of  “noise”  in  the  data, researchers rely on statistical methods of probabilistic inference to interpret the data. When data are interpreted in terms of meaning- ful parameters in a mathematical description, such as the differ- ence of mean parameters in two groups, it is Bayesian analysis that provides complete information about the credible parameter val- ues. Bayesian analysis is also more intuitive than traditional meth- ods of null hypothesis significance testing (e.g., Dienes, 2011). This article introduces an intuitive Bayesian approach to the analysis of data from two groups. The method yields complete distributional information about the means and standard deviations of the groups. In particular, the analysis reveals the relative cred- ibility of every possible difference of means, every possible dif- ference of standard deviations, and all possible effect sizes. From this explicit distribution of credible parameter values, inferences about null values can be made without ever referring to p values as in null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Unlike NHST, the Bayesian method can accept the null value, not only reject it, when certainty in the estimate is high. The new method handles outliers by  describing  the  data  as  heavy  tailed  distributions  instead  of normal distributions, to the extent implied by the data. The new},

	abstract={In this paper we describe how historical land use information has been derived for the whole of Europe, using the World Atlas of Agriculture, scale 1: 2,500,000. This paper describes the process of converting the analog land-use maps to a digital European historical land-use database, the Historical Land Use Database 1960 (HISLU60). The processing techniques that are applied in this process are commonly used for the processing of satellite imagery. The paper maps were scanned and geo-referenced. Image filtering techniques were used to eliminate the cartographic elements like text and boundaries. Land-use classes were created from the colours in the maps using image classification techniques. As a last step, GIS filtering functions were used to eliminate remaining cartographic elements and small classification errors. The HISLU60 database contains six land-use classes; arable land, grassland, forest, non-agricultural land, inland water and urban. It is a raster dataset with a cell size of 250 meters. The HISLU60 database was validated by performing a statistical comparison with three reference datasets. The overall classification accuracy is around 50 percent. Despite its limitations, the HISLU60 database gives an overview of the pan-European land use around 1960},

The methodology employed in this project allows for effectiveness and accuracy in historical data acquisition and integration, which enables refined analyses of socioeconomic and environmental phenomena. The approach outlined in this article allowed researchers  from  different  disciplines—city  historians,  archaeologists,  demographists, economists, and so on—to interpret urban phenomenologies according to different thematic keys. These interpretations were derived from archival sources that complement each other and offer diversified insights into the urban context.

We analyzed these ratios using descriptive statistics, the Games-Howell analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, and comparisons of historical GIS maps. We found that gender ratios on the American Frontier were extremely high throughout the study period and were significantly different from those in more densely populated areas. In addition, sex ratios declined as population density increased in each decade of this study. However, frontier areas still had fairly high gender ratios in 1910, thus showing ongoing significant demographic differences between those sparsely settled counties and more urbanized regions.

	journal={Fennoscandia archaeologica},

	pages={3-19},
	abstract={Population continuation versus replacement has been debated for many years in the Finnish archaeo- logical literature. The controversy surrounding the question of dwelling voids, whether they indicate population bottlenecks or not, is ongoing. We propose to utilize information as well as methods from a different discipline, genetics, in order to assess a possible population bottleneck. Ideally this could be done by analysing ancient DNA (aDNA) samples. Unfortunately, Finland almost entirely lacks well-preserved ancient organic remains which would enable extensive aDNA studies. Here, our approach is to evaluate effects of a Neolithic population bottleneck on the assumed Finnish gene pool by simulations. In this ﬁrst attempt, we focus on uniparental markers: mitochondrion and Y chromosome. We aim to assess the effects that prehistoric bottlenecks could have on the diversity of the ancient and the current gene pool.  The simulations were carried out with the population genetic simulation environment simuPOP. The results indicate that, as expected, bottlenecks have a fundamental effect on genetic diversity, even today, if the population under consideration is a rather isolated one. Immigration from neighbouring populations, even if very limited but constant over prolonged time periods, can have drastic effects on a population's genetic composition. In the future, simulations will be further reﬁned with internal subpopulations and gender speciﬁc migra- tion, as well as autosomal markers.}

	abstract={In the past twenty-five years, scholarship on the Silesian Wars (1740-42, 1744-45, and 1756-63) has adjusted our views of these conflicts. This article identifies eight conclusions that may be drawn from this scholarship. In general, they lead to a heightened respect for Austria's military capacity but also to an enhancement of Frederick the Great's reputation as a commander. They even hint that as scholars chip away at received ideas, a view of the wars that is not basically Fredrician may be attainable. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	pages={49-76},
	abstract={Cilicia on the Islamic-Byzantine frontier, or al-thughūr, in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria has been traditionally viewed as an isolated, embattled buffer zone. Yet, it was also the main transportation corridor linking Islamic and Byzantine lands, situated between the Cilician Gates, connecting to the Anatolian plateau, and the Syrian Gates, connecting to the lands of bilād al-shām. Recent survey and excavation of a fortified site occupied from the Early Islamic to Middle Byzantine period (8th to 12th centuries c.e.) in the eastern Cilician Plain offers a different perspective on the frontier. The site can be identified with Ḥiṣn al-Tīnāt, mentioned in sources as a frontier fort and timber depot and port. Its environmental context, architecture, and material culture establish links to local thughūr and wider Near Eastern networks of exchange. Further, the frontier site alludes to the complex symbiotic relationship of a militarized and economic resource-based frontier landscape.},

	abstract={"Ancient historians have demonstrated that Edward Luttwak's The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire does not accurately describe Roman grand strategy, and many conclude that there was no Roman imperial grand strategy. But the grand strategy of the Roman Empire can be studied as long as scholars ask questions that the available sources support. The field of strategic studies defines ""grand strategy"" as the allocation of a state's resources to meet its major objectives. Surviving sources regarding the patterns of troop movements in the Roman Empire show that emperors decided how to allocate resources empire-wide to meet objectives, and thus thought about grand-strategic issues even if they did not recognize the concept or engage in long-term planning.

The weaknesses in the ways in which the RMA theory has been approached are analyzed, resulting in the formation of three different, but parallel, paradigms of the RMA phenomenon (the Social Wave, the Radical Transformation, and the Continuity and Evolution). Two historical case studies, the Napoleonic RMA and the First World War RMA, are used in order to draw out the lessons learned regarding past revolutions and to examine the validity of the paradigms.

	volume = 	 {2},
	abstract = 	 {The point is often made that the rise of the modern state in Europe provided models which have been inﬂuential, if not actually copied, across much of the rest of the world. In Russia during the reign of Peter the Great (1682–1725), not only was the tsar aware of the European experience of state building, but consciously strove to base many of his political and social reforms on European models. Peter aimed at sweeping reform of the Russian state and society in the attempt to bring them into the modern world. The paper argues that the reforms were necessarily geographical, involving an attempt radically to reconstruct the country's economic and social geography. The focus is upon the spatial implications of reform, including the founding and development of the city of St. Petersburg as an experiment in social reconstruc- tion. In the event, Peter's success was only partial, and the end product quite different from the models which had inﬂuenced his reforms. It is argued that this relative failure derived not only from the widespread resistance to reform but also from geographical, social and cultural circumstances peculiar to Russia. Greater scholarly sensitivity to the social and cultural con- texts in which state building occurs might stimulate more cross-cultural and comparative per- spectives and enrich this important area of social theory.      1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	pages={617-635},
	abstract={Often the armies that emerged from the steppes of Inner Asia are viewed as throngs of horse-archers who overwhelmed their opponents through sheer ferocity or superior numbers. The typical observation about their military ability is that as nomads they were natural warriors inured since birth to riding and archery in the harsh climate of the steppe. While this view has an element of truth, the armies were actually better trained than is generally assumed. This article examines the training of Inner Asian armies. Although it focuses on the Mongols, it also explores the antecedents and evolution of training techniques across Inner Asia. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Access to fresh sources, archival and memoir, suggest that although the Soviets fell short of their political goals and performed dismally in combat, the Red Army was far more militarily effective than was appreciated by the Soviet military and political leadership, the German armed forces high command, and contemporary observers.

	abstract={<p>The main aims of this article are threefold. It initially seeks to address two popular misconceptions frequently found in crusade histories and general histories of the Byzantine empire concerning the Turkish invasion and settlement of western Anatolia after the battle of Mantzikert in 1071. The article maintains that blurring the distinctions between the Seljuk Turks of Ransum and the tribes of pastoral nomads or rather transhumants who came to be known as Turkmens or Turcomans is incorrect. The oft-repeated assumption that the Seljuk Turks of Baghdad oversaw the Turkish conquest of Anatolia is addressed when tracing the unstructured nature of the Turkish migration and the subsequent lack of unity amongst the invaders. After providing the context of the Turkish settlement in western Anatolia, the article throws new light on the relative ease with which the armies of the First Crusade traversed the Anatolian plateau and Byzantine forces compelled the speedy capitulation of Turkish towns and territories along the western coastal plains and river valleys of Anatolia in 1097 and 1098 respectively.

	abstract={Major developments in the technology and technique of warfare are commonly understood to be an important source of historical change. Not only do they alter the character of warfare, but they also prompt broader social developments. This position has been notably adopted by Clifford J. Rogers, who claims that the emergence of newly effective infantry forces was responsible for the rise of the commons during the fourteenth century. This article argues that developments in the technique of infantry warfare during the period were largely a consequence, rather than a cause, of social change. In doing so it calls for a new approach to understanding late-medieval military developments, one which is informed by the view that war is powerfully shaped by the societies which wage it.

The author believes that these shortcomings in the English-language literature on the military history of the 1688-1748 period, which currently dominates the field, demonstrate how much work remains to be done on every aspect of this crucial period, addressing once again problems that everyone believed had been closed for good.

	abstract={This article examines Napoleon's desperate scramble in 1813 to preserve French dominance in Europe by closely scrutinizing his operations and strategy. Instead of concentrating his forces for a decisive showdown with the enemy's main force, Napoleon repeatedly detached large numbers of troops under ineffective commanders to capture the Prussian capital of Berlin. The heavy losses and strategic reverses sustained by the French in these questionable undertakings left Napoleon's Grande Armee vulnerable to the massive Allied coalition that would confront him at Leipzig. This study of French military operations in North Germany highlights the breakdown of Napoleonic strategy in 1813, and demonstrates that the Allied defense of Berlin in 1813 played a significant role in Napoleon's ultimate expulsion from Germany.},

Modern military historians struggle to explain medieval strategic behaviour. One key reason, the article argues, is their strong belief in the existence of timeless strategic standards. By analysing the example of the 1415 Agincourt campaign, the article proposes a new approach to understanding late medieval strategy. By reconstructing the normative framework that underpinned strategic practice, the critical importance emerges of an unusual set of conventions which regulated strategy and which allowed for a degree of risk-taking that the traditional and current historiography cannot otherwise explain.},

	abstract={Prior to the ephebic reform (reform in recruitment) at Athens in 335 BCE, Athenian infantrymen or hoplites was generally expected to provide his own arms and armour. While their defeat at Macedonian hands at Khaironeia in 338 caused the Athenians to rethink how to assure their military preparedness, little was done until Alexander the Great departed for the Near East in the spring of 335. The resulting ephebic reform involved a massive increase in the city's hoplite forces, with the thetes, the poor of Athens, admitted to the hoplite ranks for the first time. The need to equip all the thetes as hoplites resulted in the likely adoption of a system of issue-and-return, which was the most economical one available. Nevertheless, each of the ephebes, the new recruits to the system, was given a shield and spear at state expense, an uneconomical and militarily questionable practice that was nevertheless continued, probably for reasons of tradition.},

	pages={233-257},
	abstract={In 1314 the English-held castles of Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Stirling were seized and destroyed by Robert Bruce. This was the pinnacle of a policy by which Bruce systematically slighted the castles he seized in Scotland. The reign of Edward II has been seen as a period in which the military value of the castle was in decline and by analysing the role the castle played in the campaigns of Bruce it is possible to assess the importance a successful contemporary commander attached to the castle during this period. Bruce has first-hand experience of the castle at war and knew of its limitations. In 1306, however, he seized and garrisoned a number of castles preparing to use them for a specific purpose, but defeat in the field rendered them redundant. On his return in 1307 Bruce initiated a policy of destruction. Castles in the north of Scotland were slighted as they were the regional focus of the political power of his Scottish enemies, and militarily they were of little value to Bruce. In the Lowlands the first-rate castles of Scotland were destroyed precisely because they were so militarily powerful. Bruce recognised that these castles, used aggressively, were indispensable to the English war effort, and consequently he undertook a prolonged and expensive campaign to reduce them, a campaign which involved the tactic of both surprise and assault and, more importantly, the set-piece siege. In 1314 the imminent English campaign led Bruce to launch an unprecedented offensive against the English-held castles of Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Stirling. These castles were subsequently slighted despite their inextricable association with the Scottish Crown. Bruce recognised that, unlike the English, he did not need to occupy castles in Scotland to fight the war. Although in Ireland a small number of castles were occupied, and Berwick was also garrisoned by Scottish troops, in northern England Bruce did not attempt to occupy English castles. Those which were seized were destroyed, an indication that Bruce never intended a conquest of Northumberland. Indeed Bruce never undertook a serious campaign aimed at the seizure of the first-rate castles of Northumberland despite their frequently perilous state. Instead he sought to gain political capital by threatening their loss and so placing enormous pressure on the English Crown. That the castle featured prominently in the campaigns of Bruce demonstrates it was not in decline. Bruce understood the continued military and political value of the castle, but he was able to exploit its inherent vulnerabilities in order to gain victory in war. (Author abstract)},

	abstract={<p>Historical collapse of ancient states poses intriguing social-ecological questions, as well as potential applications to global change and contemporary strategies for sustainability. Five Old World case studies are developed to identify interactive inputs, triggers, and feedbacks in devolution. Collapse is multicausal and rarely abrupt. Political simplification undermines traditional structures of authority to favor militarization, whereas disintegration is preconditioned or triggered by acute stress (insecurity, environmental or economic crises, famine), with breakdown accompanied or followed by demographic decline. Undue attention to stressors risks underestimating the intricate interplay of environmental, political, and sociocultural resilience in limiting the damages of collapse or in facilitating reconstruction. The conceptual model emphasizes resilience, as well as the historical roles of leaders, elites, and ideology. However, a historical model cannot simply be applied to contemporary problems of sustainability without adjustment for cumulative information and increasing possibilities for popular participation. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, Western Europe responded to environmental crises by innovation and intensification; such modernization was decentralized, protracted, flexible, and broadly based. Much of the current alarmist literature that claims to draw from historical experience is poorly focused, simplistic, and unhelpful. It fails to appreciate that resilience and readaptation depend on identified options, improved understanding, cultural solidarity, enlightened leadership, and opportunities for participation and fresh ideas.

	abstract={What are the impacts of economic development on spatio-temporal ﬂuctuations in intermunicipal migration? Do speciﬁc spatial patterns emerge owing to migration, and how regular are the pulses of intermunicipal migration in time and space? To answer these questions, we apply spatial and temporal autocorrelation analysis to the formations of intermunicipal migration and investigate the dependence of its dynam- ics on ﬂuctuations in gross domestic product. The regional formations of migration are constructed by identifying autocorrelative clusters of municipalities with a net migration surplus or deﬁcit. The results show that migration drains the younger gen- erations and labour force from declining areas, including some high-fertility ones. A regional pulse of diffusion with business cycles at intervals of eleven years boosts in-migration to the Finland’s largest travel-to-work areas, commencing with early economic growth in the urban cores and diffusing later to neighbouring municipalities and beyond. Intermunicipal net migration is attenuated during economic recessions and recovers later.}

	abstract={This study analyzes how a rapid period of growth of the Finnish economy affected taxable incomes by postcode area in a core-periphery setting. To investigate the ex- tent of the spread of growth and the hypotheses of spatial polarization of incomes, we analyzed the change of both income gradients and surfaces in North Karelia in 1996 and 2003. Median taxable incomes of private individuals polarized between the regional growth center with its adjacent zone of inﬂuence and the declining rural periphery, as well as between the central district and its thriving adjacent settlement ring of 5–38 kilometers. A relative decline in incomes in natural-resource towns and sparsely-populated areas prevailed. Small towns and rural areas cannot successfully compete in conditions where economic growth is based on external and internal scale economies and urban-centered uni-nodal growth strategy. The geographically narrow spread effects challenges all involved actors to develop new technologies to overcome the friction of distance with less costs and to develop small-town and rural environments where industries not hooked on agglomeration economies can operate on a proﬁtable basis.}

	journal={Health & place},
	volume={8},
	number={1},
	pages={25-35},
	abstract={Social reformer Charles Booth undertook a massive survey into the social and economic conditions of the people of London at the end of the 19th century. An important innovation of his Inquiry was the construction of large, detailed maps displaying social class of inner London on a street-by-street basis. These provide a detailed and vivid picture of the geography of poverty and affluence at this time. These maps have been digitised, georeferenced and linked to contemporary ward boundaries allowing Booth's measurement of social class to be matched to the measurement of social class in the 1991 census of population and standardised mortality ratios derived for all causes of death in the survey area between 1991 and 1995. The social class data were used to derive an index of relative poverty for both time periods and a comparison of the geographies of relative poverty and their relationship with contemporary mortality was made. Although the overall standard of living had increased, the geography of poverty at the end of the 19th century was very similar to that at the end of the 20th century. Moreover, the geography of all causes of death for people over the age of 65 was more strongly related to the geography of poverty in the late 19th century than contemporary patterns of poverty. This relationship was also true for mortality for specific diseases that are related to deprivation in early life. The paper concludes that the spatial patterns of poverty in inner London are extremely robust and a century of change has failed to disrupt it.},

	abstract={Abstract    The Umayyad qusour (desert palaces) are monumental structures built during the reign of the ﬁrst caliphate of Islam. Usually dismissed as `plea- sure palaces' or `hunting lodges,' some scholars are beginning  to  argue  that  these  prominent  structures were strategic interventions in the landscape. Until now, historians have relied mainly on textual, archi- tectural and art-historical analyses of the qusour in order to understand Umayyad state architecture. This research proposes the use of spatial analysis through GIS to lend a new dimension to the discussion. The results of the analysis show that Umayyad qusour are carefully  situated  at  routes  of  transhumance  and water sources. The distribution pattern of the Um- ayyad  qusour  is  clustered  at  the  outlet  of  Wadi Sarhan, and there is actually line-of-sight communi- cation between Azraq, Amra, Haranah, Muwaqqar,},

	journal={Journal of Archaeological Science},
	volume={40},
	pages={3946-3954},
	abstract={Humans have a cross-cultural tendency to attach strong social meanings to visually prominent land- forms. The ability to identify prominent landforms is thus important for understanding how people perceive and relate to a landscape. This is particularly true for historical landscapes, where the rela- tionship between viewer location and view may be one of the few recoverable elements available to reconstruct landscape meaning. Quantifying prominence, however, is a methodological and conceptual challenge, especially if prominence is to be measured from particular ground locations rather than from a planar view. An approach is suggested using a line simpliﬁcation technique borrowed from cartography that is repurposed to identify prominent points on a horizon line. By combining prominence values with information on the number of viewers present in different vantage points at different points in time, it is possible to reconstruct a visual prominence history for landforms in a region. This approach provides some quantitative rigor to phenomenological approaches that can be overly descriptive and insufﬁciently transparent. A case study from the American Southwest demonstrates the utility of the method. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract={Several countries have made large investments in building historical Geographical Information Systems (GIS) databases containing census and other quantitative statistics over long periods of time. Making good use of these databases requires approaches that explore spatial and temporal change. The authors use a variety of visualization and spatial analysis techniques to explore population change in Ireland during and after the Great Famine of the late 1840s. Importantly, the techniques allow differences over space and time to be explored, thus stressing the diversity between places, rather than making all places appear the same, a common criticism of many statistical approaches. The authors demonstrate the potential of these techniques to explore geographical and temporal variations in large quantitative GIS datasets. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Archival maps are an invaluable source of information about the state of the geographical environment. They represent the primary research material for analysis of changes in spatial characteristics of the environment. However, a prereq- uisite for any reliable analysis is an accurate match between archival maps and contemporary cartographic materials and the estimation of error inherent to every match. The most effective way of achieving this nowadays is to use GIS software. The aim of this work is thus to present and discuss georeferencing methods of archival paper maps that make a precise comparison with contemporary reference layers possible. Two alternative georeferencing methods for maps based or not based on a geodetic network are described, and the georeferencing of archival maps is discussed further by reference to the First, Second and Third Military Surveys of Galicia conducted by the MGI (Militärgeographisches Institut), and completed in 1783, 1863 and 1879 respectively.},

	pages={376-394},
	abstract={This study compares the accuracy of four maps available to Union and Confederate officers during the 1862 Shenandoah Valley campaign of the American Civil War. It examines historical maps of the Valley of Virginia by the following cartographers: James W. Abert, Hermann Böÿe and Lewis von Buchholtz, Jedediah Hotchkiss, and Franz Kappner. Both simple and three-tiered sinuosity measures are derived for reference points along study map representations of the Shenandoah river system. These data are then statistically compared to corresponding sinuosity data from USGS topographic quadrangles to identify the relative accuracies of the historical maps. This article offers evidence to refute the common historical assumption that Hotchkiss provided Maj. Gen. Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson with terrain intelligence that was far superior to that available to his Union opponents. Evidence indicates that maps by Union cartographers as well as the prewar Böÿe-Buchholtz map were at least as accurate, or superior to, the work of Hotchkiss. *The author would like to thank Dr. Judy M. Olson as well as the three anonymous reviewers for their beneficial and insightful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.},

	journal={Computers, Environment and Urban Systems},
	volume={35},
	pages={452-463},
	abstract={The measurement and management of positional accuracy and positional uncertainty is especially problematic in historical cartography and Historical GIS applications, for at least two reasons: ﬁrst, historical sources, and especially historical maps, generally carry a higher degree of positional inaccuracy and uncertainty compared to contemporary geographic databases; second, it is always difﬁcult and often impossible to reliably measure the positional accuracy and positional uncertainty of the spatial attribute of historical data. As an added complication, the terms ``inaccuracy'' and ``uncertainty'' are often used as synonyms in the literature, with relatively little attention given to issues of uncertainty. In this article we propose a methodology for detecting the positional inaccuracy and positional uncertainty of measurements of urban change using historical maps at a very high spatial resolution (the building). A widely accepted and routinely employed method for detecting urban change, and spatial change in general, consists in overlaying two or more maps created at different dates, but the technique can lead to the formation of spurious changes—typically, sliver polygons—that are the product of misclassiﬁcation error or map misalignment rather than actual modiﬁcations in land cover. In this paper we develop an algorithm to detect such spurious changes. More in general, we extend the discussion to examine the effects of positional uncertainty and positional inaccuracy in feature change detection analysis. The case-study is the city of Milan, Italy. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Since the end of the 18th century the Negev has attracted considerable attention due to its strategic location straddling three continents, its history, and its archeology. After the European powers recognized the geopolitical importance of this area in the mid 19th century, numerous surveys and mapping efforts were conducted. In this study we reviewed 375 historical maps covering parts or all of the Negev between 1799 and 1948. These historical maps are crucial to the understanding of colonial developments, as well as landscape and settlement processes and the sedentarization of the Bedouin population. We scanned and rectiﬁed these maps using geographic information systems (GIS) to enable quantitative analysis of their accuracy, and to reveal new insights into settlement and sedentarization processes. Whereas the median error of maps that were based on explorers notes during most of the 19th century were at the order of several kilometers, the various Palestine Exploration Fund surveys (1872–1890) reduced these errors to the order of several hundred meters, and later maps produced by the British during World War I and by British Mandatory Survey of Palestine obtained errors well below 100 m. Careful analysis of these maps allows us to delineate the boundary between cultivated land and the desert, to follow the establishment of new settlements, and to quantify the sedentarization process of the nomadic Bedouin population. We conclude that analyzing historical maps with GIS provides a tool to determine their accuracy and hence potential usefulness for the study of topics such as settlement processes and legal disputes over land ownership. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract={Religious buildings, including temples, churches, synagogues and mosques have always  been one of the integral components of the urban layout. This paper aims to answer the question whether the historical spatial development of a large-size city can be approxi- GIS mated  using  historical  geographical  and  categorical  data  pertaining  to  its  places  of Mosque worship. We use data for 525 mosques built in Izmir, Turkey, over the years 1550–2008 and  maps  of  built-up  areas  for  the  same  period.  Based  on  the  results  of  GIS/spatial statistics-based analyses using the three basic measures of spatial statistics (mean center, weighted mean center and standard deviational ellipse), we conclude that the spatial distribution of mosques is a close proxy of urban development. Thus, location data for places of worship, often available and accessible, can be used to derive historical urban development over a given period.},

	abstract={The last 10 years have seen a sudden rise in interest in the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in historical research. This has led to a field that has become known as 'historical GIS'. This development started in the more quantitative ends of the discipline but has spread to encompass qualitative research as well. Interest in historical GIS is not restricted to researchers who would previously have regarded themselves as historical geographers, but has in fact led to an increased awareness of the importance of geography from across the discipline of history. This paper introduces historical GIS and critically evaluates how it is affecting the practice of historical geography.},

	abstract={<p>This article describes the development of a GIS-based model of historical drought and population change in western Canada, designed to support qualitative field research into drought adaptation and migration. The model combines digitized census data and recently available modeled historical climate data at a 10 km... grid cell scale and can be used to generate maps of 'hotspots' where historical declines in rural populations may be associated with extended periods of heat and lack of precipitation. The results suggest a promising avenue for expanding and refining GIS-based modeling of historical human-climate interactions to support qualitative research and to potentially serve as a stepping stone toward forecasting future risk areas of drought-related migration in continental dryland areas.
