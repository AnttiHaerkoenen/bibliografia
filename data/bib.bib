A major focus of these efforts has been visibility studies and archaeologists have paid less attention to how {GIS} can facilitate the study of another important socio-spatial component, movement. This paper examines the {GIS} application of multi-criteria cost surface analysis as a robust technique for modeling past movement and applies this approach to the Late Prehistoric period (ca. {AD} 1200–1600) in Michigan as a case study. This analysis extends understandings of the role of localized connections and tribal territoriality with the spread of maize agriculture in this period and adds further support to the proposal that earthwork enclosures served as uniquely accessible ritual centers for social, economic and ideological interaction between separate tribal communities within the Late Prehistoric regional organization. By showing this technique can build on and validate models of past social developments, grant real insights into social connections and affiliations, and stimulate new directions for future research, this specific case illustrates the general heuristic value of multi-criteria cost surface analysis for exploring regional landscapes in archaeology.},

A distinction is made between the relative accessibility between two points and the integral, or total, accessibility at a point. Secondly, various operational forms of these definitions are illustrated with reference to the Hamilton, Ontario, urban area. The derivation of the various measures that are developed is discussed.

Through data collection and analysis of its content, it supports a greater mapping and understanding of the evolving human landscape. The information disseminated through such media represents a deviation from volunteered geography, in the sense that it is not geographic information per se. Nevertheless, the message often has geographic footprints, for example, in the form of locations from where the tweets originate, or references in their content to geographic entities. We argue that such data conveys ambient geospatial information, capturing for example, people’s references to locations that represent momentary social hotspots. In this paper we address a framework to harvest such ambient geospatial information, and resulting hybrid capabilities to analyze it to support situational awareness as it relates to human activities. We argue that this emergence of ambient geospatial analysis represents a second step in the evolution of geospatial data availability, following on the heels of volunteered geographical information.},

New techniques of terrain modeling and geographical analysis provide the means to augment traditional methods of boundary estimation. In this paper, I review archaeological methods for estimating the spatial location of boundaries between independent polities and ways to modify these methods to explore the processes of political expansion in the evolution of complex societies. I demonstrate several of these methods using data from Postclassic polities in the Yautepec valley, Morelos, Mexico. Through time, seven independent polities were founded, expanded, and were ultimately incorporated within two levels of regional political administration. I apply new quantitative methods for the estimation of polity territories and explore the processes that resulted in the formation of a regional polity. The resulting boundaries are objective estimates of the location of borders based on energetic efficiency that can be systematically tested against theoretical models. These estimated boundaries provide a basis for exploring the social meaning of territorial divisions. Additionally, energetic boundaries provide a means for delineating local zones for landscape utilization and comparative analyses.},

Data tabulated for different spatial scale levels or according to different zonal systems for the same region will not provide consistent analysis results. Since spatially aggregated data are often used not just in geographical research, but also in other social science and physical science disciplines, the {MAUP} has broad impacts. The {MAUP} effects are functions of the underlying spatial distribution of the data, and their spatial relationships to the spatial scale hierarchy and zonal systems. Several general approaches have been suggested to handle the {MAUP}. They include simply acknowledging its presence and possibly conducting multiscale and multizonal systems analyses to show the range of possible results. The other extreme is to develop scale-independent or insensitive analytical techniques, but it has little success. One potential direction is to develop a general framework to address the underlying processes of the {MAUP}. Based upon this framework, specific solutions may be developed.},

The nature of historical data and historiographic practices present several challenges in using {GIS} that have been addressed only partially to date. For example, although events are inherently spatial and a fundamental construct in historical reasoning, there have been few attempts to create comprehensive data models for describing them. Likewise, computational representations of historical processes and narrative remain largely undeveloped. In this research, the emerging genre of digital historical atlas is presented as a broad use case and contextualized. Its representation requirements are detailed in novel conceptual and logical models of relevant geo-historical information constructs, presented as a generalized development framework. An event-centered and information-based spatial history ontology ({SHO}) was developed by adapting and extending an existing upper ontology ({DOLCE}). Its implementation in a spatial object-relational database populated with several historical datasets is described. Some important challenges remaining in this large, ultimately collaborative undertaking are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Quantitative indices of residential segregation have been with us for half a century, but suffer significant limitations. While useful for comparison among regions, summary indices fail to reveal spatial aspects of segregation. Such measures generally consider only the population mix within zones, not between them. Zone boundaries are treated as impenetrable barriers to interaction between population subgroups, so that measurement of segregation is constrained by the zoning system, which bears no necessary relation to interaction among population subgroups. A segregation measurement approach less constrained by the chosen zoning system, which enables visualization of segregation levels at the local scale and accounts for the spatial dimension of segregation, is required. We propose a kernel density estimation approach to model spatial aspects of segregation. This provides an explicitly geographical framework for modeling and visualizing local spatial segregation. The density estimation approach lends itself to development of an index of spatial segregation with the advantage of functional compatibility with the most widely used index of segregation (the dissimilarity index D). We provide a short review of the literature on measuring segregation, briefly describe the kernel density estimation method, and illustrate how the method can be used for measuring segregation.

The nature of the model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this paper, a technique is developed, termed geographically weighted regression, which attempts to capture this variation by calibrating a multiple regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is introduced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered which can be described generally as tests for spatial nonstationarity. Using Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed for investigating the null hypothesis that the data may be described by a global model rather than a non-stationary one and also for testing whether individual regression coefficients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on a data set from the 1991 U.K. census relating car ownership rates to social class and male unemployment. The paper concludes by discussing ways in which the technique can be extended.},

	url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/probability-interpret/},
	abstract = {‘Interpreting probability’ is a commonly used butmisleading characterization of a worthy enterprise. The so-called‘interpretations of probability’ would be better called‘analyses of various concepts of probability’, and‘interpreting probability’ is the task of providing suchanalyses. Or perhaps better still, if our goal is to transform inexactconcepts of probability familiar to ordinary folk into exact onessuitable for philosophical and scientific theorizing, then the task maybe one of ‘explication’ in the sense of Carnap (1950).Normally, we speak of interpreting a formal system, that is,attaching familiar meanings to the primitive terms in its axioms andtheorems, usually with an eye to turning them into true statementsabout some subject of interest. However, there is no single formalsystem that is ‘probability’, but rather a host of suchsystems. To be sure, Kolmogorov's axiomatization, which we will presentshortly, has achieved the status of orthodoxy, and it is typically whatphilosophers have in mind when they think of ‘probabilitytheory’. Nevertheless, several of the leading‘interpretations of probability’ fail to satisfy all {ofKolmogorov}'s axioms, yet they have not lost their title for that.Moreover, various other quantities that have nothing to do withprobability do satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms, and thus areinterpretations of it in a strict sense: normalized mass, length, area,volume, and other quantities that fall under the scope of measuretheory, the abstract mathematical theory that generalizes suchquantities. Nobody seriously considers these to be‘interpretations of probability’, however, because they donot play the right role in our conceptual apparatus. Instead, we willbe concerned here with various probability-like concepts thatpurportedly do. Be all that as it may, we will follow common usage anddrop the cringing scare quotes in our survey of what philosophers havetaken to be the chief interpretations of probability., Whatever we call it, the project of finding such interpretations is animportant one. Probability is virtually ubiquitous. It plays a role inalmost all the sciences. It underpins much of the social sciences— witness the prevalent use of statistical testing, confidenceintervals, regression methods, and so on. It finds its way, moreover,into much of philosophy. In epistemology, the philosophy of mind, andcognitive science, we see states of opinion being modeled bysubjective probability functions, and learning being modeled by theupdating of such functions. Since probability theory is central todecision theory and game theory, it has ramifications for ethics andpolitical philosophy. It figures prominently in such staples ofmetaphysics as causation and laws of nature. It appears again in thephilosophy of science in the analysis of confirmation of theories,scientific explanation, and in the philosophy of specific scientifictheories, such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, andgenetics. It can even take center stage in the philosophy of logic,the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of religion. Thus,problems in the foundations of probability bear at least indirectly,and sometimes directly, upon central scientific, social scientific,and philosophical concerns. The interpretation of probability is oneof the most important such foundational problems.},

	abstract = {The measurement of residential segregation patterns and trends has been limited by a reliance on segregation measures that do not appropriately take into account the spatial patterning of population distributions. In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index (P̃*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index (H̃), a spatial relative diversity index (R̃), and a spatial dissimilarity index (D̃). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index P̃*—which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals’ local spatial environments—and the spatial information theory index H̃—which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual—are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine the geographical relation between mortality and deprivation in England and Wales at the start of the 20th and 21st centuries. To explore the evidence for a strengthening or weakening of this relation over the century and test for relations between the mortality and deprivation patterns of a century ago and modern mortality and causes of death.
Design Census and mortality data for 634 districts from the 1900s directly compared with interpolated ward level data from 2001.
Setting Census data and national statistics for England and Wales in the 1900s and 2001.
Population Entire population in both periods.
Main outcome measures Standardised mortality ratios for all districts for both periods with additional cause specific ratios calculated for 2001. Deprivation (Carstairs) scores for each district in 2001, with comparable measure created for the 1900s. Correlations and partial correlations between deprivation scores and standardised mortality ratios in the 1900s and 2001 for the 614 districts for which all data were available.
Results The was no evidence of a significant change in the strength of the relation between deprivation and mortality between the start and end of the 20th century. Modern patterns of mortality and deprivation remain closely related to the patterns of a century ago. Even after adjustment for modern deprivation, standardised mortality ratios from the 1900s show a significant correlation with modern mortality and most modern causes of death. Conversely, however, there was no significant relation between deprivation in the 1900s and modern mortality for most causes of death after adjustment for modern deprivation.
Conclusions Despite all the medical, public health, social, economic, and political changes over the 20th century, patterns of poverty and mortality and the relations between them remain firmly entrenched. There is a strong relation between the mortality levels of a century ago and those of today. This goes beyond what would have been expected from the continuing relation between deprivation and mortality and holds true for most major modern causes of death.},

	abstract = {Quantitative indices of residential segregation have been with us for half a century, but suffer significant limitations. While useful for comparison among regions, summary indices fail to reveal spatial aspects of segregation. Such measures generally consider only the population mix within zones, not between them. Zone boundaries are treated as impenetrable barriers to interaction between population subgroups, so that measurement of segregation is constrained by the zoning system, which bears no necessary relation to interaction among population subgroups. A segregation measurement approach less constrained by the chosen zoning system, which enables visualization of segregation levels at the local scale and accounts for the spatial dimension of segregation, is required. We propose a kernel density estimation approach to model spatial aspects of segregation. This provides an explicitly geographical framework for modeling and visualizing local spatial segregation. The density estimation approach lends itself to development of an index of spatial segregation with the advantage of functional compatibility with the most widely used index of segregation (the dissimilarity index D). We provide a short review of the literature on measuring segregation, briefly describe the kernel density estimation method, and illustrate how the method can be used for measuring segregation. Examples using a simulated landscape and two empirical cases in Washington, {DC} and Philadelphia, {PA} are presented.},
